# Project WiLLM
This is a Large Language model, I am trying to build from scratch, just as a fun project. I got this idea because I am excited at the thought of having my personal LLM that produces poetry like William Shakespeare and Content that is competent with other Classical Authors who's dataset I have.
Potential Goals and current problems:
- Data Engineering and Cleaning the Datasets because they are raw and technically our model produces inaccurate results.
- Hoping to learn fine tuning and the day I do it, I will start improving it
