(THE accomplishments which distin- 7 


guish the trained actor from the 
amateur are not the same as the quali- 
ties which distinguish great actors from 
ordinary ones. ‘Take, first, the difter- 
ence between the trained actor and the 
man in the street—the layman. When 
the layman walks, his only object is to 
get to Charing Cross; when he makes 
a gesture, it is to attract the attention 
of a cab-driver or bus-conductor; when 
he speaks, it is to convey or demand 
information, or tell a lie, or otherwise 
further his prosaic ends; when he moves 
his hands, it is to put up his umbrella 
or to take out his handkerchief. On 
the stage these merely utilitarian pur- 
poses are only simulated: the real pur- 
pose 1s to produce an effect on the 
senses and imagination of the spectator. 
The actor’s walk is addressed to the 
spectator’s sense of grace, dignity, or 
strength of movement, and his voice to 
the listener’s sense of expressive or 
beautiful tone. Impersonations even of 


15 


he 
ctor 


ugly or deformed creatures with harsh 
voices have the same artistic character, 
and are agreeably disagreeable, just as 
the most extreme discords in a sym- 
phony or opera are distinctly musical, 
and perfectly different to the random 
cacophonies which arise from the tun- 
ing of the orchestra. Now, the power 
of complying with artistic conditions 
without being so preoccupied by them 
as to be incapable of thinking of any- 
thing else is hard to acquire, and can 
be perfected only by long practice. 
-Talma estimated the apprenticeship at 
twenty years. The habit can never be- 
come as instinctive as keeping one’s bal- 
ance, for instance, because failure in 
that for even an instant means a fall, 
so that the practice in it is lifelong and 
constant; whereas the artistic habit 
lapses more or less in the absence of 
an audience, and even on the stage can 
be forgotten for long periods without 
any worse consequences than a loss of 
charm which nothing may bring to the 


16 


actor’s attention. The real safeguard 
against such lapses is a sense of beauty 
—the artistic sense—cultivated to such 
a degree of sensitiveness that a coarse 
or prosaic tone, or an awkward gesture, 
jars instantly on the artist as a note 
out of tune jars on the musician. The 
defect of the old-fashioned systems of 
training for the stage was that they 
attempted to prescribe the conclusions 
of this constantly evolving artistic sense 
instead of cultivating it and leaving the 
artist to its guidance. ‘Thus they taught 
you an old-fashioned stage-walk, an old- 
fashioned stage-voice, an old-fashioned 
stage way of kneeling, of sitting down, 
of shaking hands, of picking up a hand- 
kerchief, and so on, each of them sup- 
posed to be the final and perfect way 
of doing it. The end of that was, of 
course, to discredit training altogether. 
But neglect of training very quickly dis- 
credits itself; and it will now perhaps 
be admitted that the awakening and 
culture of the artistic conscience is a real 


17 


service which a teacher can render to an 
actor. When that conscience is thor- 
oughly awakened and cultivated, when 
a person can maintain vigilant artistic 
sensitiveness throughout a performance 
whilst making all the movements re- 
quired by the action of the drama, and 
speaking all its dialogue graphically 
without preoccupation or embarrass- 
ment, then that person is a technically 
competent artistic actor, able to play a 
part of which he hardly comprehends 
one line, in a play of which he knows 
nothing except his own words and 
speeches and the cues thereto, much 
more intelligibly and effectively, as 
well as agreeably, than a statesman 
with ten times his general ability 
could. He can only be beaten, in fact, 
by the professional rival who has 
equal skill in execution, but has more 
numerous and valuable ideas to exe- 
cute. The finest actors—Jefferson, Co- 
quelin, Salvini, Duse—carry this tech- 
nical skill to such a point that though 


18 


they act so beautifully that you cannot 
take your eyes off them even when you 
do not understand what they are saying, 
yet the beauty seems so spontaneous and 
inevitable that it is generally quite im- 
possible to persuade their admirers that 
there is any art or study in their acting 
at all. The Saturday Review, 12th 
October 1895.

theatrical illusion. Between the Cesars, 
the emperors, the Christian heroes, the 
Grand Old Men, the kings, prophets, 
saints, heroes and judges, of the news- 
papers and the popular imagination, and 
the actual Juliuses, Napoleons, Gor- 
dons, Gladstones, and so on, there is 
the same difference as between Hamlet 
and Sir Henry Irving. ‘The case is not 
one of fanciful similitude, but of iden- 
tity. [he great critics are those who 
penetrate and understand the illusion: 
the great men are those who, as drama- 
tists planning the development of na- 
tions, or as actors carrying out the 
drama, are behind the scenes of the 
world instead of gaping and gushing in 
the auditorium after paying their taxes 
at the doors. And yet Shakespear, with 
the rarest opportunities of observing 
this, lets his pregnant metaphor slip, 
and, with his usual incapacity for pur- 
suing any idea, wanders off into a 
grandmotherly Elizabethan edition of

form of anarchy on which modern 
civilization 1s based: that is, the aban-

individual liberty, to the upshot of 
competition for personal gain between 
private capitalists, is a disastrous fail- 
ure, and is, by the mere necessities of 
the case, giving way to ordered Social-

ments. Cesar and Cleopatra, p. 193. 


The claim of art to our respect must 
stand or fall with the validity of its 
pretension to cultivate and refine our 
senses and faculties until seeing, hear- 
ing, feeling, smelling, and tasting be- 
come highly conscious and critical acts 
with us, protesting vehemently against 
ugliness, noise, discordant speech, frow- 
zy clothing, and re-breathed air, and 
taking keen interest and pleasure in 
beauty, in music, and in nature, besides 
making us insist, as necessary for com- 


22 


fort and decency, on clean, wholesome, 
handsome fabrics to wear, and utensils 
of fine material and elegant workman- 
ship to handle. Further, art should 
refine our sense of character and con- 
duct, of justice and sympathy, greatly 
heightening our self-knowledge, self- 
control, precision of action, and consid- 
erateness, and making us intolerant of 
baseness, cruelty, injustice, and intellec- 
tual superficiality or vulgarity. The 
worthy artist or craftsman is he who 
serves the physical and moral senses 
by feeding them with pictures, musical 
compositions, pleasant houses and gar- 
dens, good clothes and fine implements, 
poems, fictions, essays, and dramas 
which call the heightened senses and 
ennobled faculties into pleasurable ac- 
tivity. The great artist is he who goes 
a step beyond the demand, and, by sup- 
plying works of a higher beauty and a 
higher interest than have yet been per- 
ceived, succeeds, after a brief struggle 
with its strangeness, in adding this fresh 


23 


extension of sense to the heritage of the 


race. The Sanity of Art, p. 68. 


I am convinced that fine art is the 
subtlest, the most seductive, the most 
effective means of moral propagandism 
in the world, excepting only the example 
of personal conduct; and I waive even 
this exception in favour of the art of 
the stage, because it works by exhibiting 
examples of personal conduct made in- 
telligible and moving to crowds of un- 
observant unreflecting people to whom 
real life means nothing. Author's Apol- 
ogy. Mrs. Warren's Profession, p. 25. 


The severity of artistic discipline 1s 
produced by the fact that in creative 
art no ready-made rules can help you. 
There is nothing to guide you to the 
right expression for your thought ex- 
cept your own sense of beauty and fit- 
ness; and, as you advance upon those 
who went before you, that sense of 
beauty and fitness is necessarily often in 


24 


conflict, not with fixed rules, because 
there are no rules, but with precedents. 


The Sanity of Art, p. 82. 


In all the arts there is a distinction be- 
tween the mere physical artistic faculty, 
consisting of a very fine sense of color, 
form, tone, rhythmic movement, and so 
on, and that supreme sense of humanity 
which alone can raise the art work cre- 
ated by the physical artistic faculties into 
a convincing presentment of life. The 
Saturday Review, 6th June 1896. 


All art is gratuitous; and the will to 
produce it, like the will to live, must be 
held to justify itself. When that will 
is associated with brilliant specific talent 
for the established forms and attractions 
of fine art, no advance is made, because 
the artist can distinguish and satisfy 
himself by novel, witty and touching 
rehandlings of the old themes. If 
Wagner had possessed the astonishing 
specific talent of Mozart, or Mr. 
George Meredith that of Dickens, they 


25 


would not have been forced to make a 
revolution in their art by lifting it to 
a plane on which it developed new and 
extraordinary specific talents in them- 
selves, and revealed the old specific tal- 
ents to them as mere hindrances. A 
critic who has not learned this from the 
nineteenth century has learned nothing. 
Such a one, on discovering that a writer 
is deficient in all current specific talents, 
at once condemns him without benefit 
of clergy. But for my part, when I 
find the characteristic devotion of the 
born artist accompanied by a hopeless 
deficiency in all the fashionable specific 
talents I immediately give him my most 
respectful attention, and am particularly 
careful to indulge in none of those 
prophecies of extinction which were so 
confidently launched at Wagner, Ibsen, 
and Meredith. The Saturday Review, 
2nd April 1898. 


I call Madox Brown a Realist because 
he had vitality enough to find intense 


26 


enjoyment and inexhaustible interest in 
the world as it really 1s, unbeautified, 
unidealized, untitivated in any way for 
artistic consumption. ‘This love of life 
and knowledge of its worth is a rare 
thing—whole Alps and Andes above the 
common market demand for prettiness, 
fashionableness, refinement, elegance 
of style, delicacy of sentiment, charm 
of character, sympathetic philosophy 
(the philosophy of the happy ending), 
decorative moral systems contrasting 
roseate and rapturous vice with lilied 
and languorous virtue, and making 
‘“ Love’”’ face both ways as the univer- 
sal softener and redeemer, the whole 
being worshipped as beauty or virtue, 
and set in the place of life to narrow 
and condition it instead of enlarging 
and fulfilling it. “Io such self-indulgence 
most artists are mere pandars; for the 
sense of beauty needed to make a man 
an artist is so strong that the sense of 
life in him must needs be quite pro- 
digious to overpower it. It must always 


27 


be a mystery to the ordinary beauty- 
fancying, life-shirking amateur how the 
realist in art can bring his unbeautified, 
remorseless celebrations of common life 
in among so many pretty, pleasant, 
sweet, noble, touching fictions, and yet 
take his place there among the highest, 
although the railing, the derision, the 
protest, the positive disgust, are almost 
universal at first. The Saturday Re- 
view, 13th March 1897. 


Turn to Mr. Watts, and you are in- 
stantly in a visionary world, in which 
life fades into mist, and the imaginings 
of nobility and beauty with which we 
invest life become embodied and visible. 
The gallery is one great transfiguration: 
life, death, love, and mankind are no 
longer themselves: they are glorified, 
sublimified, lovelified: the very draperies 
are either rippling lakes of color har- 
mony, or splendid banners like the fly- 
ing cloak of Titian’s Bacchus in the 
National Gallery. To pretend that the 


28 


world ts like this is to live the heavenly 
life. It is to lose the whole world and 
gain one’s own soul. Until you have 
reached the point of realizing what an 
astonishingly bad bargain that is you 
cannot doubt the sufficiency of Mr. 
Watts’ art, provided only your eyes are 
fine enough to understand its language 
of line and color. The Saturday Re- 
view, 13th March 1897. 


Truly the secret of wisdom is to become 
as a little child again. But our art- 
loving authors will not learn the lesson. 
They cannot understand that when a 
great genius lays hands on a form of 
art and fascinates all who understand 
its language with it, he makes it say all 
that it can say, and leaves it exhausted. 
When Bach has got the last word out 
of the fugue, Mozart out of the opera, 
Beethoven out of the symphony, Wag- 
ner out of the symphonic drama, their 
enraptured admirers exclaim: ‘‘ Our 
masters have shewn us the way: let us 


29 


compose some more fugues, operas, 
symphonies, and Bayreuth dramas.” 
Through just the same error the men 
who have turned dramatists on the 
frivolous ground of their love for the 
theatre have plagued a weary world 
with Shakespearean dramas in five acts 
and in blank verse, with artificial com- 
edies after Congreve and Sheridan, and 
with the romantic goody-goody fiction 
which was squeezed dry by a hundred 
strong hands in the first half of this 
century. It is only when we are dissat- 
isfied with existing masterpieces that we 
create new ones: if we merely worship 
them, we only try to repeat the exploit 
of their creator by picking out the tit- 
bits and stringing them together, 1n some 
feeble fashion of our own, into a “ new 
and original”? botching of what our 
master left a good and finished job. 
We are encouraged in our folly by the 
need of the multitude for intermediaries 
between its childishness and the ma- 
turity of the mighty men of art, and 


30 


also by the fact that art fecundated by 
itself gains a certain lapdog refinement, 
very acceptable to lovers of lapdogs. 
The Incas of Peru cultivated their royal 
race in this way, each Inca marrying his 
sister. he result was that an average 
Inca was worth about as much as an 
average fashionable drama bred care- 
fully from the last pair of fashionable 
dramas, themselves bred in ‘the same 
way, with perhaps a cross of novel. 
But vital art work comes always from 
a cross between art and life: art being 
of one sex only, and quite sterile by it- 
self. Such a cross is always possible; 
for though the artist may not have the 
capacity to bring his art into contact 
with the higher life of his time, ferment- 
ing in its religion, its philosophy, its 
science, and its statesmanship (perhaps, 
indeed, there may not be any statesman- 
ship going), he can at least bring it into 
contact with the obvious life and com- 
mon passions of the streets. The Sat- 
urday Review, 6th November 1897. 


31 


aoe RT for art’s sake’? means in prac- 
Sake tice ‘“‘ Success for money’s sake.”’ 
Great art is never produced for its own 
sake. It is too difficult to be worth the 
effort. All the great artists enter into 
a terrible struggle with the public, often 
involving bitter poverty and personal hu- 
miliation, and always involving calumny 
and persecution, because they believe 
they are apostles doing what used to be 
called the Will of God, and is now called 
by many prosaic names, of which “ pub- 
lic work” is the least controversial. 
And when these artists have travailed 
and brought forth, and at last forced the 
public to associate keen pleasure and 
deep interest with their methods and 
morals, a crowd of smaller men—art 
confectioners, we may call them—hasten 
to make pretty entertainments out of 
scrap and crumbs from the master- 
pieces. Offenbach laid hands on Beet- 
hoven’s Seventh Symphony and _ pro- 
duced J’aime les militaires, to the dis- 
gust of Schumann, who was nevertheless 


32 


doing precisely the same thing in a more 
pretentious way. And these confection- 
ers are by no means mere plagiarists. 
They bring all sorts of engaging qualli- 
ties to their work: love of beauty, desire 
to give pleasure, tenderness, humor, 
everything except the high republican 
conscience, the identification of the art- 
ist’s purpose with the purpose of the 
universe, which alone makes an artist 
great. Three Plays by Brieux, Preface, 
Bp. XX., XX1. 


New ideas make their technique as wa- 
ter makes its channel; and the technician 
without ideas is as useless as the canal 
constructor without water, though he 
may do very skilfully what the Missis- 
sippi does very crudely. Three Plays 
for Puritans, p. xxxill.

class article for a third-class price, and 
a second-class article for a second-class 
price, preferring the third-class contract 
if, as often happens, it is the more prof- 
itable. First-class work he cannot do 
at all: and the man who can do it, the 
artist, cannot do anything else. When 
second or third-class work is demanded, 
he may, and very often does, try to do 
it for the sake of the money, a man 
with a wife and family being, as Talley- 
rand said, capable of anything; but he 
inevitably botches it, and only confirms 
his employer’s prejudice against artists 
and in favor of tradesmen. A Bovril 
or Condensed Milk poster by Sir Ed- 
ward Burne-Jones would probably be 
worth no more than Wagner’s Philadel- 
phia Centennial march. 

But the world is not quite so clear-cut 
as this description of it. The distinction 
between artist and tradesman is not a 
distinction between one man and an- 
other, but between two sides of the same 
man. ‘The number of persons who, be- 


ok 


ing unquestionably eminent artists, have 
yet been so absolutely uncommercial as 
to be uninfluenced by their market, 1s 
very small indeed; and of these some, 
like Giotto, have found their market so 
entirely sympathetic that in doing as 
they pleased they simply sailed before 
the wind; whilst others, like Shelley, 
Goethe, or Landor, were independent 
of it in point of both money and social 
standing. Beethoven, Wagner, and 
Ibsen, though dependent on their art 
for both money and position, certainly 
did eventually take Europe by the scrutt 
of the neck and say, ‘ You shall take 
what I like and not what you want’’; 
but in comparison with Bunyan and 
Blake they were keen men of business. 
I know of no dramatist dependent on 
his profession who has not been very 
seriously influenced by his market. 
Shakespear’s case, the leading one for 
England, is beyond a doubt. He would 
have starved if he had followed his bent 


towards a genuine science of life and 
35 


character. His instinct for reality had 
to be surreptitiously gratified under the 
mask of comedy. Dr. Johnson pointed 
out long ago that it was only in comedy 
that our immortal stalking horse for 
bogus criticism was really happy. To 
this day such splendid melodramas as 
Othello, with its noble savage, its vil- 
lain, its funny man, its carefully as- 
sorted pathetic and heavy feminine in- 
terest, its smothering and suicide, its 
police-court morality and commonplace 
thought; or, As You Like It, with its 
Adelphi hero, its prize fight, its coquet 
in tights, its good father and wicked 
uncle, represent the greatness of Shak- 
spear to nine-tenths of his adorers, 
who mostly, when you mention Helena, 
or the Countess of Rousillon, or Isa- 
bella, or Cressida, or Ulysses, or Ber- 
tram stare at you, and think you are 
talking about Calderon and Homer.

am as fond of fine music and handsome 
building as Milton was, or Cromwell,

were becoming the instruments of a sys-

would hold it good statesmanship to 
blow every cathedral in the world to 
pieces with dynamite, organ and all, 
without the least heed to the screams 
of the art critics and cultured volup- 
tuaries. And when I see that the nine- 
teenth century has crowned the tidola- 
try of Art with the deification of Love, 
so that every poet is supposed to have 
pierced to the holy of holies when he

KETHOVEN was the first man 
who used music with absolute in- 

tegrity as the expression of his own 

emotional life. Others had shewn 
how it could be done—had done it 
themselves as a curiosity of their art in 
rare, self-indulgent, unprofessional mo- 
ments—but Beethoven made this, and 
nothing else, his business. Stupendous 
as the resultant difference was between 
his music and any other ever heard in 
the world before his time, the distinc- 
tion is not clearly apprehended to this 
day, because there was nothing new in 
the musical expression of emotion: 
every progression in Bach is sanctified 
by emotion; and Mozart’s subtlety, 
delicacy, and exquisite tender touch 
and noble feeling were the despair of 
all the musical world. ' But Bach’s 


43 


Beethoven 


theme was not himself, but his religion; 
and Mozart was always the dramatist 
and story-teller, making the men and 
women of his imagination speak, and 
dramatizing even the instruments in his 
orchestra, so that you know their very 
sex the moment their voices reach 
you. Haydn really came nearer to 
Beethoven, for he is neither the praiser 
of God nor the dramatist, but, always 
within the limits of good manners and 
of his primary function as a purveyor 
of formal decorative music, a man of 
moods. ‘This is how he created the 
symphony and put it ready-made into 
Beethoven’s hand. The _ revolution- 
ary giant at once seized it, and, throw- 
ing supernatural religion, convention- 
al good manners, dramatic fiction, and 
all external standards and objects into 
the lumber room, took his own human- 
ity as the material of his music, and 
expressed it all without compromise, 
from his roughest jocularity to his 
holiest aspiration after what purely hu-

In thus fearlessly expressing himself, 
he has, by his common humanity, ex-

beautifully, how strongly, how trust-

by the immense superiority of the 
Beethoven symphony to any oratorio 
or opera. The Saturday Review, 14th

LIKE all highly developed litera- 

tures, the Bible contains a great 
deal of sensational fiction, imagined 
with intense vividness, appealing to the 
most susceptible passions, and narrated 
with a force which the ordinary man 
is quite unable to resist. Perhaps only 
an expert can thoroughly appreciate 
the power with which a story well told, 


45 


The

| 
or an assertion well made, takes pos-, 
session of a mind not specially trained 
to criticize it. Try to imagine all that 
is most powerful in English literature 
bound into one volume, and offered to 
a comparatively barbarous race as an 
instrument of civilization invested with 
supernatural authority! Indeed, let 
us leave what we call barbarous races 
out of the question, and suppose it of- 
fered to the English nation on the same 
assumptions as to its nature and au- 
thority which the children in our popu- 
lar schools are led to make to-day con- 
cerning the Bible under the School 
Board compromise! How much re- 
sistance would there be to the illusion 
created by the art of our great story- 
tellers? Who would dare to affirm 
that the men and women created by 
Chaucer, Shakespear, Bunyan, Field- 
ing, Goldsmith, Scott and Dickens had 
never existed? Who could resist the 
force of conviction carried by the tre- 
mendous assertive power of Cobbett, 


46 


the gorgeous special-pleading of Rus- 
kin, or the cogency of Sir Thomas 
More, or even Matthew Arnold? 
Above all, who could stand up against 
the inspiration and moral grandeur of 
our prophets and poets, from Lang-

of Scripture has not waned with the 
ages. We have no right to trick a 
child’s instinctive sense of revelation 
and inspiration by such a surpassingly 
blasphemous pessimistic lie as that both 
have become extinct, and that the 
wretched world, like its dead moon, is 


living out its old age on a scanty rem- | 
nant of spiritual energy, hoarded from | 


thousands of years ago. And yet the 
whole question at stake in the School 
Board election was whether this lie 
should be told as a black lie or a white 
one. The stupid part of the business 
is that it is quite unnecessary to tell any 
lies at all. Why not teach children

The truth is, laws, religions, creeds, and 
systems of ethics, instead of making so-

worse than its average unit, because 
they are neverupto date. You will ask 
me: * Why have them at all?” I will 
tell you. They are made necessary, 
though we all secretly detest them, by 
the fact that the number of people 
who can think out a line of conduct for 
themselves even on one point is very 
small, and the number who can afford 
the time for it still smaller. Nobody 
can afford the time to do it on all points.

career of the conventionally respectable, 
and sensible Worldly Wiseman as no 
better at bottom than the life and death 
of Mr. Badman: all this, expressed by| 
Bunyan in the terms of a tinker’s theol-| 
ogy, is what Nietzsche has expressed 
in terms of post-Darwinian, post-Scho- 
penhauerian philosophy; Wagner in) 
terms of polytheistic mythology; and Ib- 
sen in terms of mid-nineteenth century 
Parisian dramaturgy. Nothing is new in 
these matters except their novelties: for 


58 











instance, it is a novelty to call Justifica- 
tion by Faith “* Wille,” and Justification 
by Works “ Vorstellung.’”’ The sole 
use of the novelty is that you and I buy 
and read Schopenhauer’s treatise on Will 
and Representation when we should not 
dream of buying a set of sermons on 
Faith versus Works. At bottom the 
controversy is the same, and the dra- 
matic results are the same. Bunyan 
makes no attempt to present his pilgrims

A FIER Shakespear, the dramatists 

were in the position of Spohr after 
Mozart. A ravishing secular art had 
been opened up to them, and was refin- 
ing their senses and ennobling their ro- 
mantic illusions and enthusiasms instead 
of merely stirring up their basest pas- 
sions. Cultivated lovers of the beauties 
of Shakespear’s art—true amateurs, in 
fact—took the place of the Marlovian 


64 


crew. Such amateurs, let loose in a 
field newly reaped by a great master, 
have always been able to glean some 
dropped ears, and even to raise a brief 
aftermath. In this way the world has 
gained many charming and _ fanciful, 
though not really original, works of art 
—blank verse dramas after Shakespear, 
rhetorical frescces after Raphael, fugues 
after Bach, operas after Mozart, sym- 
phonies after Beethoven, and so on. 
This, I take it, is the distinction between 
Marlowe and Company and the firm of 
Beaumont and Fletcher. The pair wrote 
a good deal that was pretty disgraceful; 
but at all events they had been educated 
out of the possibility of writing Titus 
Andronicus. They had no depth, no 
conviction, no religious or philosophic 
basis, no real power or seriousness— 
Shakespear himself was a poor master 
in such matters—but they were dainty 
romantic poets, and really humorous 
character-sketchers in Shakespear’s pop- 
ular style: that is, they neither knew nor

NY ERO was popular with the people: 

his despotism reached them only in 
the shape of splendid entertainments. 
His government was so unrepresentative, 
so undemocratic, that it was no govern- 
ment at all: the moment the people im- 
mediately about Nero had the sense to 
tell him that if he did not cut his own 


66 


throat they would save him the trouble, 
he had to obey like the meanest gladi- 
ator. To attain real power, he should 
have made himself the keystone of an 
oligarchy. ‘To attain extensive power 
that oligarchy would have had to make 
itself the keystone of a democracy. Let 
me put this evolutionary process in 
blunter terms. An assassin may be 
feared and dreaded; but he can enjoy 
neither power nor safety. To escape 
from this position he associates other 
assassins with him and becomes a brig- 
and. To make brigandage pay, it is 
soon necessary to resort to blackmail, 
and protect travellers who pay for pro- 
tection. Thus the brigands, with the 
worst possible intentions, find themselves 
transformed into a police force. At 
last they become regular policemen as 
poachers become gamekeepers. At 
which point their power reaches its max- 
imum. Hence the paradox that Democ- 
racy represents the extreme of possible 
State tyranny. Unpublished.

Democracy is really only an arrange- 
ment by which the whole people are 
given a certain share in the control of 
the government. It has never been 
proved that this is ideally the best ar- 
rangement: it became necessary because 
the people willed to have it; and it has 
been made effective only to the very 
limited extent short of which the dis- 
satisfaction of the majority would have 
taken the form of actual violence. Now 
when men had to submit to kings, they 
consoled themselves by making it an 
article of faith that the king was always 
right—idealized him as a Pope, in fact. 
In the same way we who have to submit 
to majorities set up Voltaire’s pope, 
‘“ Monsieur Tout-le-monde,’” and make 
it blasphemy against Democracy to deny 
that the majority is always right, al- 
though that, as Ibsen says, is a lie. It 
is a scientific fact that the majority, how- 
ever eager it may be for the reform of 
old abuses, is always wrong in its opinion 
of new developments, or rather is al- 


68 


ways unfit for them (for it can hardly 
be said to be wrong in opposing de- 
velopments for which it is not yet fit). 
The pioneer is a tiny minority for the 
force he heads; and so, though it is 
easy to be in a minority and yet be 
wrong, it is absolutely impossible to be 
in the majority and yet be right as to 
the newest social prospects. We should 
never progress at all if it were possible 
for each of us to stand still on demo- 
cratic principles until we saw whither all 
the rest were moving, as our statesmen 
declare themselves bound to do when 
they are called upon to lead. What- 
ever clatter we may make for a time 
with our filing through feudal serf col- 
lars and kicking off rusty capitalistic fet- 
ters, we shall never march a step for- 
ward except at the heels of “ the strong- 
est man, he who is able to stand alone ”’ 
and to turn his back on ‘‘ the damned 
compact Liberal majority.” All of 
which is no disparagement of adult suf- 
frage, payment of members, annual par- 


69 


liaments and so on, but simply a whole- 
some reduction of them to their real 
place in the social economy as pure ma- 
chinery—machinery which has absolute- 
ly no principles except the principles of 
mechanics, and no motive power in it- 
self whatsoever. The idealization of 
public organizations is as dangerous as 
that of kings or priests. We need to be 
reminded that though there is in the 
world a vast number of buildings in 
which a certain ritual is conducted be- 
fore crowds called congregations by a 
functionary called a priest, who is sub- 
ject to a central council controlling all 
such functionaries on a few points, there 
is not therefore any such thing in re- 
ality as the ideal Catholic Church, nor 
ever was, nor ever will be. There may, 
too, be a highly elaborate organization 
of public affairs; but there is no such 
thing as the ideal State. All. abstrac- 
tions invested with collective conscious- 
ness or collective authority, set above 
the individual, and exacting duty from 


7O 


him on pretence of acting or thinking 
with greater validity than he, are man- 
eating idols red with human sacrifices.

We must either breed political ca- 
pacity or be ruined by Democracy, which 
was forced on us by the failure of the 
older alternatives. Yet if Despotism 
failed only for want of a capable be- 
nevolent despot, what chance has De- 
mocracy, which requires a whole popu- 
lation of capable voters: that is, of 
political critics who, if they cannot gov- 
ern in person for lack of spare energy 
or specific talent for administration, can 
at least recognize and appreciate capac- 
ity and benevolence in others, and so 
govern through capably benevolent rep- 
resentatives? Where are such voters 
to be found to-day? Nowhere. Pro- 
miscuous breeding has produced a weak- 
ness of character that is too timid to 
face the full stringency of a thoroughly

Real democracy is impossible without 
public opinion. And in our system 
the difficulty is not, as we so often 
say, that public opinion is not enlight- 
ened. The difficulty is that public opin- 
ion does not exist. There is literally 
no such thing. Opinion means a view 
of the world; and a view of the world 
means an income. Unpublished.

In fact he thinks you a cad if you ask 
him to carry it out under such circum- 
stances. Just like the Merchant of Ven- 
ice, you know. But if a Jew makes an 
agreement, he means to keep it and ex- 
pects you to keep it. If he wants money 
for a time, he borrows it and knows 
he must pay it at the end of the time.

Originality gives a man an air of frank- 
ness, generosity and magnanimity by 
enabling him to estimate the value of 
truth, money, or success in any particu- 
lar instance quite independently of con- 
vention and moral generalization. He 


SI 


therefore will not, in the ordinary Treas- 
ury Bench fashion, tell a lie which every- 
body knows to be a lie (and consequent- 
ly expects him as a matter of good taste 
to tell). His lies are not -found out: 

they pass for candors. He understands 
the paradox of money, and gives it away, 
when he can get most for it; in other: 
words, when its value is least which is. 
just when a common man tries hardest 
to get it. He knows that the real mo- 
ment of success is not the moment ap- 
parent to the crowd. Hence, in order 
to produce an impression of complete 
disinterestedness and magnanimity, he 
has only to act with entire selfishness; 
and this is perhaps the only sense in 
which a man can be said to be naturally 
great. 

It is in this sense that I have repre- 
sented Cxsar as great. Having virtue, 
he has no need of goodness. He is 
neither forgivir.g, frank; nor’ generous, 
because a man who is too great to resent 
has nothing to forgive; a man who says 


82 





things that other people are afraid to 
say need be no more frank than Bis- 
marck was; and there is no generosity 
in giving things you do not want to 
people of whom you intend to make use. 
This distinction between virtue and 
goodness is not understood in England: 
hence the poverty of our drama in 
heroes. Our stage attempts at them are 
mere goody-goodies. Goodness, in its 
popular British sense of self-denial, im- 
plies that man is vicious by nature, and 
that supreme goodness is supreme mar- 
tyrdom. Not sharing that pious opin- 
ion, | have not given countenance to it 
in any of my plays. In this I follow 
the precedent of the ancient myths, 
which represent the hero as vanquishing 
his enemies, not in fair fight, but with 
enchanted sword, superequine horse and 
magic invulnerability, the possession of 
which, from the vulgar moralistic point 
of view, robs his exploits of any merit 
whatever.

AMMON overreached himself

der the guise of indissoluble marriage. 
For the Church tried to shelter this in- 
human doctrine and flat contradiction of 
the gospel by claiming, and rightly claim- 
ing, that marriage is a sacrament. So 
it is; but that is exactly what makes di- 
vorce a duty when the marriage has lost 
the inward and spiritual grace of which 
the marriage ceremony is the outward 
and visible sign. In vain do bishops 
stoop to pick up the discarded arguments 


86 


of the atheists of fifty years ago by 
pleading that the words of Jesus were 
in an obscure Aramaic dialect, and were 
probably misunderstood, as Jesus, they 
think, could not have said anything a 
bishop would disapprove of. Unless 
they are prepared to add that the state- 
ment that those who take the sacrament 
with their lips but not with their hearts 
eat and drink their own damnation is 
also a mistranslation from the Aramaic, 
they are most solemnly bound to shield 
marriage from profanation, not merely 
by permitting divorce, but by making it 
compulsory in certain cases as the Chi- 
nese do. Getting Married, p. 195.

pre-eminently sanctified thing, Duty? 
Evidently it cannot have come off scathe- 
less. First there was man’s duty to God, 


88 


: 
: 


| 


with the priest as assessor. That was 
repudiated; and then came Man’s duty 
to his neighbor, with Society as the as- 
sessor. Will this too be repudiated, and 
be succeeded by Man’s duty to himself, 
assessed by himself? And if so, what 
will be the effect on the conception of 
Duty in the abstract? Let us see. 

Duty arises at first, a gloomy tyranny, 
out of man’s helplessness, his self-mis- 
trust, in a word, his abstract fear. He 
personifies all that he abstractly fears as 
God, and straightway becomes the slave 
of his duty to God. He imposes that 
slavery fiercely on his children, threat- 
ening them with hell, and punishing 
them for their attempts to be happy. 
When, becoming bolder, he ceases to 
fear everything, and dares to love some- 
thing, this duty of his to what he fears 
evolves into a sense of duty to what he 
loves. Sometimes he again personifies 
what he loves as God: and the God of 
Wrath becomes the God of Love; some- 
times he at once becomesa humanitarian, 


89 


an altruist, acknowledging only his duty 
to his neighbor. ‘This stage is correla- 
tive to the rationalist stage in the evo- 
lution of philosophy and the capitalist 
phase in the evolution of industry. But 
in it the emancipated slave of God falls 
under the dominion of Society, which, 
having just reached a phase in which all 
the love is ground out of it by the com- 
petitive struggle for money, remorseless- 
ly crushes him until, in due course of the 
further growth of his spirit or will, a 
sense at last arises in him of his duty 
to himself. And when this sense is fully 
grown, which it hardly is. yet, the tyr- 
rany of duty is broken; for now the 
man’s God is himself; and he, self-sat- 
ished at last, ceases to be selfish. The

—duty and duty alone has brought us 
thus far? But why not? God was once 
the most sacred of our conceptions; and 
he had to be denied. Then Reason be- 
came the Infallible Pope, only to be 
deposed in turn. Is Duty more sacred 
than God or Reason?

PAMILY life will never be decent, 
much less ennobling, until the central 
horror of the dependence of women on 
men is done away with. At present it 
reduces the difference between mar- 
riage and prostitution to the difference 
between ‘Trade Unionism and unorgan- 
ized casual labor: a huge difference, no 
doubt, as to order and comfort, but not 

a difference in kind.

POWERFUL among the enemies of 

Shakespear are the commentator 
and the elocutionist: the commentator 
because, not knowing Shakespear’s lan- 
guage, he sharpens his reasoning faculty 
to examine propositions advanced by an 
eminent lecturer from the Midlands, in- 
stead of sensitizing his artistic faculty 
to receive the impression of moods and 
inflexions of feeling conveyed by word- 
music; the elocutionist because he is a 
born fool, in which capacity, observing 


95 


The ; 
Elocutionist 


with pain that poets have a weakness for 
imparting to their dramatic dialogue a 
quality which he describes and deplores 
as ‘‘sing-song,’ he devotes his life to 
the art of breaking up verse in such a 
way as to make it sound like insanely 
- pompous prose. ‘The effect of this on 
Shakespear’s earlier verse, which is full 
of the naive delight of pure oscillation, 
to be enjoyed as an Italian enjoys a barc- 
arolle, or a child a swing, or a baby 
a rocking-cradle, is destructively stupid. 
In the later plays, where the barcarolle 
measure has evolved into much more 
varied and complex rhythms, it does not 
matter so much since the work is no 
longer simple enough for a fool to pick 
to pieces. But in every play from Love’s 
Labour’s Lost to Henry V. the elocu- 
tionist meddles simply as a murderer, 
and ought to be dealt with as such with- 
out benefit of clergy. To our young 
people studying for the stage I say, with 
all solemnity, learn how to pronounce 
the English alphabet clearly and beautt- 


96 


fully from some person who is at once 
an artist and a phonetic expert. And 
then leave blank verse patiently alone 
until you have experienced emotion deep 
enough to crave for poetic expression, 
at which point verse will seem an abso- 
lutely natural and real form of speech to 
you. Meanwhile, if any pedant, with an 
uncultivated heart and a theoretic ear, 
proposes to teach you to recite, send in- 
stantly for the police. The Saturday Re-

The End 
the Means 


Ee Stish HOME life as we understand it is no 
Home more natural to us than a cage is 
natural to a cockatoo. Its grave dan- 
ger to the nation lies in its narrow views, 
its unnaturally sustained and spitefully 
jealous concupiscences, its petty tyr- 
ranies, its false social pretences, its end- 
less grudges and squabbles, its sacrifice 
of the boy’s future by setting him to 
earn money to help the family when he 
should be in training for his adult life 
(remember the boy Dickens and the 
blacking factory), and of the girl’s 
chances by making her a slave to sick or 
selfish parents, its unnatural packing into 
little brick boxes of little parcels of hu- 
manity of ill-assorted ages, with the old 
scolding or beating the young for be- 
having like young people, and the young 
hating and thwarting the old for behav- 
ing like old people, and all the other 
ills, mentionable and unmentionable, 
that arise from excessive segregation. It 
sets these evils up as benefits and bless- 
ings representing the highest attainable 


98 


degree of honor and virtue, whilst any 
criticism of or revolt against them is 
savagely persecuted as the extremity of 
vice. he revolt, driven underground 
and exacerbated, produces debauchery 
veiled by hypocrisy, and overwhelming 
demand for licentious theatrical enter- 
tainments which no censorship can stem, 
and, worst of all, a confusion of virtue 
with the mere morality that steals its 
name until the real thing is loathed be- 
cause the imposture is loathsome. 
Getting Married, pp. 132, 133. 


If on any night at the busiest part of 
the theatrical season in London the au- 
diences were cordoned by the police and 
examined individually as to their views 
on the subject, there would probably 
not be a single house-owning native 
among them who would not conceive a 
visit to the theatre, or indeed to any 
public assembly, artistic or political, as 
an exceptional way of spending an even- 
ing, the normal English way being to 


oo. 


sit in separate families in separate 
houses, each person silently occupied 
with a book, a paper, or a game of 
halma, cut off equally from the blessings 
of society and solitude. You may make 
the acquaintance of a thousand streets 
of middle-class English families without 
coming on a trace of any consciousness 
of citizenship, or any artistic cultivation 
of the senses. The condition of the men 
is bad enough, in spite of their daily 
escape into the city, because they carry 
the exclusive and unsocial habits of “ the 
home” with them into the wider world 
of their business. Amiable and compan- 
ionable enough by nature, they are, by 
home training, so incredibly ill-man- 
nered, that not even their interest, as 
men of business in welcoming a possible 
customer in every inquirer, can correct 
their habit of treating everybody who 
has not been “ introduced”’ as a stran- 
ger and intruder. The women, who 
have not even the city to educate them, 
are much worse: they are positively un-

APOLEON. No Englishman is 
too low to have scruples: no Eng- 
lishman is high enough to be free from 
their tyranny. But every Englishman 
is born with a certain miraculous power 
that makes him master of the world. 
When he wants a thing, he never tells 
himself that he wants it. He waits pa- 
tiently until there comes into his mind, 
no one knows how, a burning conviction 
that it is his moral and religious duty 
to conquer those who have got the thing 
he wants. Then he becomes irresistible. 
Like the aristocrat, he does what pleases 
him and grabs what he covets: like the 
shopkeeper, he pursues his purpose with 
the industry and steadfastness that come 
from strong religious conviction and

deep sense of moral responsibility. He 
is never at a loss for an effective moral 
attitude. As the great champion of 
freedom and national independence, he 
conquers and annexes half the world, and 
calls it Colonization. When he wants 
a new market for his adulterated Man- 
chester goods, he sends a missionary to 
teach the natives the Gospel of Peace. 
The natives kill the missionary: he flies 
to arms in defence of Christianity; fights 
for it; conquers for it; and takes the 
market as a reward from heaven. In 
defence of his island shores, he puts a 
chaplain on board his ship; nails a flag 
with a cross on it to his top-gallant mast; 
and sails to the ends of the earth, sink- 
ing, burning and destroying all who 
dispute the empire of the seas with him. 
He boasts that a slave is free the mo- 
ment his foot touches British soil; and 
he sells the children of his poor at six 
years of age to work under the lash in 
his factories for sixteen hours a day. 
He makes two revolutions, and then de- 


102 


clares war on our one in the name of law 
and order. ‘There is nothing so bad or 
so good that you will not find English- 
men doing it; but you will never find an 
Englishman in the wrong. He does

business principles; he enslaves you on 
imperial principles; he bullies you on 
manly principles; he supports his king 
on loyal principles and cuts off his king’s 
head on republican principles. His 
watchword is always Duty; and he 
never forgets that the nation which lets 
its duty get on the opposite side to its 
interest is lost. The Man of Destiny,

The 
Englishman 
and the 
Comic 
Spirit 


thing else, especially more than fine art, 
his attitude towards which, culture-affec- 
tation apart, is one of half diffiident, 
half contemptuous curiosity; and of 
course more than clear-headedness, spir- 
itual insight, truth, justice and so forth. 
It is precisely this unscrupulousness and 
singleness of purpose that constitutes the 
Englishman’s pre-eminent ‘‘ common 
sense’; and this sort of common sense, 
I submit to Mr. Meredith, is not only 
not ‘‘ the basis of the comic,’’ but actu- 
ally makes comedy impossible, because 
it would not seem like common sense at 
all if it were not self-satisfiedly uncon- 
scious of its moral and intellectual blunt- 
ness, whereas the function of comedy 
is to dispel such unconsciousness by turn- 
ing the searchlight of the keenest moral 
and intellectual analysis right on to it. 
Now the Frenchman, the Irishman, the 
American, the ancient Greek, is disabled 
from this true British common sense by 
intellectual virtuosity, leading to a love 
of accurate and complete consciousness 


106 


of things—of intellectual mastery of 
them. ‘This produces a positive enjoy- 
ment of disillusion (the most dreaded 
and hated of calamities in England) and 
consequently a love of comedy (the fine 
art of disillusion) deep enough to make 
huge sacrifices of dearly idealized insti- 
tutions to it. Thus, in France, Moliére 
was allowed to destroy the Marquises. 
In England he could not have shaken 
even such titles as the accidental sher- 
iff’s knighthood of the late Sir Augus- 
tus Harris. And yet the Englishman 
thinks himself much more independent, 
level-headed, and genuinely republican 
than the Frenchman—not without good 
superficial reasons; for nations with the 
genius of comedy often carry all the 
snobbish ambitions and idealist enthusi- 
asms of the Englishman to an extreme 
which the Englishman himself laughs at. 
But they sacrifice them to comedy, to 
which the Englishman sacrifices nothing ; 
so that, in the upshot, aristocracies, 
thrones and churches go by the board 


107 


at the attack of comedy among our de- 
votedly conventional, loyal and fanat- 
ical next door neighbors, whilst we, 
having absolutely no disinterested re- 
gard for such institutions, draw a few 
of their sharpest teeth, and then main- 
tain them determinedly as part of the 
machinery of worldly success. 

The Englishman prides himself on this 
anti-comedic common sense of his as at 
least eminently practical. As a matter 
of fact, it is just as often as not most 
pigheadedly unpractical. For example, 
electric telegraphy, telephony and trac- 
tion are invented, and establish them- 
selves as necessities of civilized life. 
The unpractical foreigner recognizes the 
fact, and takes the obvious step of put- 
ting up poles in his streets to carry wires. 
This expedient never occurs to the 
Briton. He wastes leagues of wire and 
does unheard-of damage to property by 
tying his wires and posts to such chim- 
ney stacks as he canbeguilehouseholders 
into letting him have access to. Finally, 


108 


when it comes to electric traction, and 
the housetops are out of the question, he 
suddenly comes out in the novel charac- 
ter of an amateur in urban picturesque- 
ness, and declares that the necessary 
cable apparatus would spoil the appear- 
ance of our streets. The streets of Nu- 
remberg, the heights of Fiesole, may not 
be perceptibly the worse for these con- 
trivances; but the beauty of Tottenham 
Court Road is too sacred to be so pro- 
faned: to its loveliness the strained bus- 
horse and his offal are the only acces- 
sories endurable by the beauty-loving 
Cockney eye. This is your common- 
sense Englishman. His helplessness in 
the face of electricity is typical of his 
helplessness in the face of everything 
else that lies outside the set of habits he 
calls his opinions and capacities. In the 
theatre he is the same. It is not common 
sense to laugh at your own prejudices: 
it is common sense to feel insulted when 
any one else laughs at them. Besides, the 
Englishman is a serious person: that is, 


109 


he is firmly persuaded that his prejudices 
and stupidities are the vital material of 
civilization, and that it is only by hold- 
ing on to their moral prestige with the 
stiffest resolution that the world is saved 
from flying back into savagery and go- 
rilladom, which he always conceives, in 
spite of natural history, as a condition 
of lawlessness and promiscuity, instead 
of, as it actually is, the extremity, long 
since grown unbearable, of his own no- 
tions of law and order, morality and 
conventional respectability. Thus he is 
a moralist, an ascetic, a Christian, a 
truth-teller and a plain dealer by profes- 
sion and by conviction; and it is wholly 
against this conviction that, judged by 
his own canons, he finds himself in prac- 
tice a great rogue, a liar, an unconscion- 
able pirate, a grinder of the face of the 
poor, and a libertine. Mr. Meredith 
points out daintily that the cure for this 
self-treasonable confusion and darkness 
is Comedy, whose spirit overhead will 
‘look humanely malign and cast an 


IIo 


oblique light on them, followed by vol- 
leys of silvery laughter.” Yes, Mr. 
Meredith; but suppose the patients have 
‘““common sense ’”’ enough not to want to 
be cured! Suppose they realize the im- 
mense commercial advantage of keeping 
their ideal life and their practical busi- 
ness life in two separate conscience-tight 
compartments, which nothing but “ the 
Comic Spirit ”’ can knock into one! Sup- 
pose, therefore, they dread the Comic 
Spirit more than anything else in the 
world, shrinking from its “ illumina- 
tion,” and considering its “‘ silvery laugh- 
ter’? in execrable taste! Surely in 
doing so they are only carrying out the 
common-sense view, in which an encour- 
agement and enjoyment of comedy must 
appear as silly and suicidal and “ un- 
English ” as the conduct of the man who 
sets fire to his own house for the sake 
of seeing the flying sparks, the red glow 
in the sky, the fantastic shadows on 
the walls, the excitement of the crowd, 
the gleaming charge of the engines, and 


Iil 


the dismay of the neighbors. No doubt 
the day will come when we shall de- 
liberately burn a London street every 
day to keep our city up to date in health 
and handsomeness, with no more misgiv- 
ing as to our common sense than we now 
have when sending our clothes to the 
laundry every week. When that day 
comes, perhaps comedy will be popular 
too; for, after all, the function of com- 
edy, as Mr. Meredith after twenty years’ 
further consideration is perhaps by this 
time ripe to admit, is nothing less than 
the destruction of old-established morals. 
Unfortunately, today such iconoclasm 
can be tolerated by our playgoing citi- 
zens only as a counsel of despair and 
pessimism. They can find a dreadful 
joy in it when it is done seriously, or 
even grimly and terribly as they under- 
stand Ibsen to be doing it; but that it 
should be done with levity, with silvery 
laughter like the crackling of thorns un- 
der a pot, is too scandalously wicked, 
too cynical, too heartlessly shocking to 


112 


be borne. Consequently our plays must 
either be exploitations of old-established 
morals or tragic challengings of the or- 
der of Nature. Reductions to absurd- 
ity, however logical; banterings, how- 
ever kindly; irony, however delicate; 
merriment, however silvery, are out of 
the question in matters of morality, ex- 
cept among men with a natural appetite 
for comedy which must be satisfied at 
all costs and hazards: that is to say, not 
among the English playgoing public, 
which positively dislikes comedy. 

No doubt it is patriotically indulgent 
of Mr. Meredith to say that ‘ Our 
English school has not clearly imagined 
society,” and that ‘‘ of the mind hover- 
ing above congregated men and women 
it has imagined nothing.” But is he 
quite sure that the audiences of our Eng- 
lish school do not know too much about 
society and “congregated men and 
women’’ to encourage any exposures 
from ‘‘the vigilant Comic,” with its 
~ thoughtful laughter,” its ‘‘ oblique il- 


113 


lumination,” and the rest of it? May it 
not occur to the purchasers of half- 
guinea stalls that it is bad enough to 
have to put up with the pryings of Fac- 
tory Inspectors, Public Analysts, County 
Council Inspectors, Chartered Account- 
ants and the like, without admitting this 
Comic Spirit to look into still more dell- 
cate matters? Is it clear that the Comic 
Spirit would break into silvery laughter 
if it saw all that the nineteenth century 
has to show it beneath the veneer? 
There is Ibsen, for instance: he is not 
lacking, one judges, in the Comic Spirit; 
yet his laughter does not sound very 
silvery, does it? No: if this were an 
age for comedies, Mr. Meredith would 
have been asked for one before this. 
How would a comedy from him be rel- 
ished, I wonder, by the people who 
wanted to have the revisers of the Au- 
thorized Version of the Bible prosecuted 
for blasphemy because they corrected as 
many of its mistranslations as they dared, 
and who reviled Froude for not sup- 


114 


pressing Carlyle’s diary and writing a 
fictitious biography of him, instead of 
letting out the truth? Comedy, indeed! 
I drop the subject with a hollow laugh.

The 
Personal 
Factor 


BARRY SULLIVAN 
Famous BARRY SULLIVAN was a splendid- 


ly monstrous performer in_ his 
prime: there was hardly any part sufh- 
ciently heroic for him to be natural in it. 
He had deficiencies in his nature or 
rather blanks, but no weaknesses, be- 
cause he had what people call no heart. 
Being a fine man, as proud as Lucifer, 
and gifted with an intense energy which 
had enabled him to cultivate himself 
physically to a superb degree, he was the 
very incarnation of the old individual- 
istic, tyrannical conception of a great ac- 
tor. By magnifying that conception to

DUSE 


But in Duse you necessarily get the 
great school in its perfect integrity, be- 
118 


cause Duse without her genius would 
be a plain little woman of no use to any 
manager, whereas Miss Terry or Miss 
Achurch, if they had no more skill than 
can be acquired by any person of ordi- 
nary capacity in the course of a few 
years’ experience, would always find a 
certain degree of favour as pretty lead- 
ing ladies. Duse with her genius, is so 
fascinating that it is positively difficult 
to attend to the play instead of attend- 
ing wholly to her. The extraordinary 
richness of her art can only be under- 
stood by those who have studied the 
process by which an actress is built up. 
You offer a part to a young lady who ts 
an enthusiastic beginner. She reads it 
devoutly, and forms, say, half a dozen 
great ideas as to points which she will 
make. ‘The difficulty then is to induce 
her to do nothing between these points; 
so that the play may be allowed at such 
moments to play itself. Probably when 
it comes to the point, these intervals 
will prove the only effective periods dur- 


119 


ing her performance, the points being ill 
chosen or awkwardly executed. The 
majority of actresses never get beyond 
learning not to invent new points for 
themselves, but rather to pick out in 
their parts the passages which admit of 
certain well worn and tried old points 
being reapplied. When they have learnt 
to make these points smoothly and to 
keep quiet between whiles with a grace- 
ful air of having good reasons for do- 
ing nothing, they are finished actresses. 
The great actress has a harder struggle. 
She goes on inventing her points and her 
business determinedly, constantly in- 
creasing the original half-dozen, and 
constantly executing them with greater 
force and smoothness. A time comes 
when she 1s always making points, and 
making them well; and this is the finish- 
ing point with some actresses. But with 
the greatest artists there soon com- 
mences an integration of the points into 
a continuous whole, at which stage the 
actress appears to make no points at all, 


120 


and to proceed in the most unstudied 
and “natural” way. ‘his rare con- 
summation Duse has reached. An at- 
tentive study of her Marguerite Gau- 
thier, for instance, by a highly trained 
observer of such things, will bring to 
light how its apparently simple strokes 
are combinations of a whole series of 
strokes, separately conceived originally, 
and added one by one to the part, un- 
til finally, after many years of evolu- 
tion, they have integrated into one single 
highly complex stroke. Take, as a very 
simple illustration, the business of Ca- 
mille’s tying up the flowers in the third 
act. It seems the most natural thing » 
in the world; but it is really the final de- 
velopment of a highly evolved dance 
with the arms—-even, when you watch 
it consciously, a rather prolonged and 
elaborate one. The strokes of charac- 
ter have grown up in just the same way. 
And this is the secret of the extraordi- 
nary interest of such acting. There are 
years of work, bodily and mental, be- 


I2I 


hind every instant of it—work, mind, 
not mere practice and habit, which is 
quite a different thing. It is the rarity 
of the gigantic energy needed to sustain 
this work which makes Duse so excep- 
tional; for the work is in her case high- 
ly intellectual work, and so requires 
energy of a quality altogether superior 
to the mere head of steam needed to 
produce Bernhardtian explosions with 
the requisite regularity. With such 
high energy, mere personal fascination 
becomes a thing which the actress can 
put off and on like a garment. Sarah 
Bernhardt has nothing but her own 
‘charm, for the exhibition of which Sar- 
dou contrives love scenes—save the 
mark. Duse’s own private charm has 
not yet been given to the public. She 
gives you Césarine’s charm, Marguerite 
Gauthier’s charm, the charm of La Lo- 
candiera, the charm, in short, belonging 
to the character she impersonates; and 
you are enthralled by its reality and de- 
lighted by the magical skill of the artist 


122 


without for a moment feeling any com- 
plicity either on your own part or hers 
in the passion represented. And with 
that clue to the consistency of supreme 
admiration for the artist with perfect 
respect for the woman—a combination 
so rare that some people doubt its pos- 
sibility—I must leave discussion of the 
plays she has appeared in this week to 
my next article—The Saturday Review, 


8th June 1895. 
ONE of the strongest objections to 


the institution of monogamy is 
the existence of its offspring, the conven- 
tional farcical comedy. ‘The old warn- 
ing, ‘‘ Beware how you kiss when you 
do not love,” ought to be paraphrased 
on the playbills of all our lighter 
theatres as ‘‘ Beware how you laugh 
when you do not enjoy.” To laugh 
without sympathy is a ruinous abuse of 
a noble function; and the degredation 
of any race may be measured by the de- 
gree of their addiction to it. In its 


123 


The 
Farcical 
Comedy 


subtler forms it is dying very hard: for 
instance, we find people who would not 
join in the laughter of a crowd of peas- 
ants at the village idiot, or tolerate the 
public flogging or pillorying of a crim- 
inal, booking seats to shout with laugh- 
ter at a farcical comedy which is, at 
bottom, the same thing—namely, the 
deliberate indulgence of that horrible, 
derisive joy in humiliation and suffering 
which is the beastliest element in human 
nature. I make these portentous obser- 
vations not by way of breaking a but- 
terfly on a wheel, but in order to bring 
out with violent emphasis the distinction 
between the high and the base comedy 
of errors—between Pink Dominos and 
Twelfth Night; or, to illustrate from 
another art, between the caricatures of 
Leech or Gavarni and those which mark 
the last intolerable stages of the degra- 
dation of Ally Sloper (who in his or- 
iginal Ross-Duval days was not without 
his merits). To produce high art in 
the theatre, the author must create per- 


124 


sons whose fortunes we can follow as 
those of a friend or enemy: to produce 
base laughter, it is only necessary to 
turn human beings on to the stage as 
rats are turned into a pit, that they may 
be worried for the entertainment of the 
spectators. The Saturday Review, 9th 
May 1896. 


Unless comedy touches me as well as 
amuses me, it leaves me with a sense of 
having wasted my evening. I go to the 
theatre to be moved to laughter, not to 
be tickled or bustled into it; and that 1s 
why, though I laugh as much as anybody 
at a farcical comedy, I am out of spirits 
before the end of the second act, and 
out of temper before the end of the 
third, my miserable mechanical laughter 
intensifying these symptoms at every 
outburst. If the public ever becomes in-: 
telligent enough to know when it is really 
enjoying itself and when it is not, there 
will be an end of farcical comedy. The 
Saturday Review, 23d February, 1895.

I KNOW that my “ ignorant and inex- 

perienced God ” disgusts people who 
are accustomed to the best of every- 
thing. The old-fashioned gentleman 
who felt that God would not lightly 
damn a man of his quality has given 
place to the lady who declines to be 
saved by a deity who is not absolutely 
first-class in every particular. Sir Isaac 
Newton’s confession of ignorance and 
inexperience seems to her to mark a 


126 


lower grade of character and _ intelli- 
gence than the assurance of Mr. Stig- 
gins, who knows everything and can 
move mountains with his faith. I know 
this high-class deity very well. When 
I hire a furnished house for my holli- 
days, as I very often do, I find his por- 
traitin the best bedroom. It is the por- 
trait of a perfect gentleman, not older 
than thirty-eight, with nice hair, a nice 
beard, nice draperies, a nice pet lamb 
under his arm or somewhere about, and 
an expression which combines the tone 
of the best society with the fascination 
of Wilson Barrett as Hamlet. The 
ladies who worship him are themselves 
worshipped by innumerable poor Job- 
lings in shabby lodgings who pin up the 
Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty on 
their walls. Far be it from me to mock 
at this worship: if you dare not or can- 
not look the universe in the face you will 
at least be the better for adoring that 
spark of the divine beauty and the eter- 
nal force that glimmers through the 


127 


weaknesses and inadequacies of a pretty 
man or a handsome woman; but please, 
dear sect of sweethearts, do not mock 
at me either. You have your nicely 
buttered little problem and are content 
with its nicely buttered little solution. I 
have to face a larger problem and find 
a larger solution; and since on my scale 
the butter runs short I must serve the 
bread of life dry. The Academy, 29th

T is impossible to prove that the gov- 
erning few have ever, in any gener- 
ally valid sense, been the ablest men of 
their time. James I. governed Shake-

When power and riches are thrown hap- 
hazard into children’s cradles as they 
are in England, you get a governing 
class without industry, character, cour- 
age, or real experience; and under such 
circumstances reforms are produced 
only by catastrophes followed by panics 
in which ‘something must be done.”

achieve a Public Health Act, a Crimean 
War to reform the Civil Service, and a

LORD SUMMERHAYS. Men are not gov- 
erned by justice, but by law or persua-

by law or persuasion, they have to be 
governed by force or fraud, or both. I 
used both when law and persuasion 
failed me. Every ruler of men since 
the world began has done so, even when 
he has hated both fraud and force as 
heartily as I do. Musalliance (unpub-

We are all now under what Burke called 
‘the hoofs of the swinish multitude.” 
Burke’s language gave great offence be- 
cause the implied exceptions to its uni- 
versal application made it a class insult; 
and it certainly was not for the pot to 
call the kettle black. The aristocracy 
he defended, in spite of the political 


130 


marriages by which it tried to secure 
breeding for itself, had its mind under- 
trained by silly schoolmasters and gov- 
ernesses, its character corrupted by 
gratuitous luxury, its self-respect adul- 
terated to complete spuriousness by 
flattery and flunkeyism. It is no better 
to-day and never will be any better: our 
very peasants have something morally 
hardier in them that culminates occa- 
sionally in a Bunyan, a Burns, or a Car- 
lyle. But observe, this aristocracy, 
which was overpowered from 1832 to 
1885 by the middle class, has come back 
to power by the votes of “the swinish 
multitude.’’ ‘om Paine has triumphed 
over Edmund Burke; and the swine are 
now courted electors. How many of 
their own class have these electors sent 
to parliament? MHardly a dozen out of 
670, and these only under the persua- 
sion of conspicuous personal qualifica- 
tions and popular eloquence. The mul- 
titude thus pronounces judgment on its 
Own units: it admits itself unfit to gov- 


131 


ern, and will vote only for a man mor- 
phologically and generically transhgured 
by palatial residence and equipage, by 
transcendent tailoring, by the glamor of 
aristocratic kinship. Well, we two 
know these transfigured persons, these 
college passmen, these well groomed 
monocular Algys and Bobbies, these 
cricketers to whom age brings golf in- 
stead of wisdom, these plutocratic prod- 
ucts of “the nail and sarspan business 
as he got his money by.” Do they 
know whether to laugh or cry at the no- 
tion that they, poor devils! will drive 
a team of continents as they drive a 
four-in-hand; turn a jostling anarchy of 
casual trade and speculation into an or- 
dered productivity; and federate our 
colonies into a world-Power of the first 
magnitude? Give these people the 
most perfect political constitution and 
the soundest political program that 
benevolent omniscience can devise for 
them, and they will interpret it into 
mere fashionable folly or canting charity

philosophical theology of a Scotch mis- 
sionary into crude African idolatry.

A King is an idol: that is why I am a 
Republican. The New Age, 2nd June 
1g 10. 


When an artificial aristocracy is created 
by idolization it will work with all the 
appearance of a natural and inevitable 
system as long as the aristocrats not 
only wear their trappings and keep up 
the observances which set their daily 
lives and habits apart from those of or- 
dinary folk, but also do the work which 
the idolization system was invented to 
provide for, and without which it has no 
sense. But once let them evade the 
work whilst retaining the privileges, 
and they will become an idle class, and, 
as such, an inferior class; for no mortal 
power can maintain the idler at a higher 
level than the worker. The idol who 


133 


does not earn his worship is an impostor 
and a robber; and it is found in practice 
that whereas an aristocracy which really 
governs can maintain its supremacy even 
when its members are in their personal 
conduct what we should call infernal 
scoundrels, aristocracies of the most 
charming ladies and gentlemen imagin- 
able who do not govern, finally collapse 
and are trampled out with every circum- 
stance of violence and insult by the mob. 
By the mob I mean the unidolized. 

The question for the political scientist, 
in other words for the Fabian, is 
whether it is possible to devise any sys- 
tem of constitutional checks or safe- 
guards by which the system of govern- 
ment by idolized aristocracy can be 
secured against this danger. And when 
I say idolized aristocracy, I include its 
latest form, which is an idolized bureau- 
cracy of experts. Socialism without 
experts 1s as impossible as shipbuilding 
without experts or dentistry without ex- 
perts. In so far as we have already 


134 


done without experts, we have done 
without Socialism; and all the fears ex- 
pressed that Socialism will produce a 
huge increase of officialism are quite 
well grounded: under Socialism we shall 
all be officials, actually or potentially.

worth seizing at any cost. For this 
the overthrow of the begging, cadging,

tem means the substitution of the cer-

pert oficial management, the standard 
wages and hours of work, the sensitive- 
ness to public opinion (including that 
of the class to which the patients be- 
long), the subjection to fierce criticism 
by party newspapers keen for scandals 
to be used as local electioneering capi- 
tal, all of which have been called into 
action by the immense development in 
local government under the Acts of the 
last ten years. Of course, as long as 
ignorant philanthropists, and people 
anxious to buy positions as public bene-

private subscription, the ratepayers and

as a romance for your entertainment : 
he says, in effect, “ Here is yourself and 
myself, our society, our civilization. 
The evil and good, the horror and the 
hope of it, are woven out of your life 
and mine.” The Saturday Review,

If Ibsen were to visit London, and ex- 
press his opinion of our English theatre 
—as Wagner expressed his opinion of 
the Philharmonic Society, for example 
—our actors and managers would go 
down to posterity as exactly such per- 
sons as Ibsen described them. He 1s 
master of the situation, this man of 
genius; and when we complain that he 
does not share our trumpery little no- 
tions of life and society; that the themes 


147 


Ibsen 


that make us whine and wince have no 
terrors for him, but infinite interest; and 
that he is far above the barmaid’s and 
shop superintendent’s obligation to be 
agreeable to Tom, Dick and Harry 
(which naturally convinces Tom, Dick 
and Harry that he is no gentleman), 
we are not making out a case against 
him, but simply stating the grounds of 
his eminence. When any person objects 
to an Ibsen play because it does not 
hold the mirror up to his own mind, I 
can only remind him that a horse might 
make exactly the same objection. For 
my own part, I do not endorse all Ib- 
sen’s views: I even prefer my own plays 
to his in some respects; but I hope I 
know a great man from a little one as 
far as my comprehension of such things 
goes. Criticism may be pardoned for 
every.mistake except that of not know- 
ing a man of rank in literature when it 
meets one. The Saturday Review, 30th

W HEN an American journalist de- Ibsen ana 


scribes Sir Edward Burne-Jones 
as © [he English Gustave Doré,” or 
declares Madox Brown to have been 
‘as a realist, second only to Frith,” he 
means well; and possibly the victims of 
his good intentions give him credit for 
them. But I do most earnestly beg the 
inhabitants of this island to be extreme- 
ly careful how they compare any for- 
eigner to Shakespear. ‘The foreigner 
can know nothing of Shakspear’s power 
over language. He can only judge 
him by his intellectual force and dra- 
matic insight, quite apart from his 
beauty of expression. From such a 
test Ibsen comes out with a double first 
class: Shakespear comes out hardly any- 
where. Our English deficiency in ana- 
lytic power makes it extremely hard for 
us to understand how a man who is 
great in any respect can be insignificant 
in any other respect; and perhaps the 
average foreigner is not much cleverer. 
But when the foreigner has the particu- 


149 


Shakespear 


lar respect in which our man ts great 
cut off from him artificially by the 
change of language, as a screen of col- 
oured glass will shut off certain rays 
from a camera, then the deficiency which 
is concealed even from our experts by 
the splendour of Shakespear’s literary 
gift, may be obvious to quite common- 
place people who know him _ only 
through translations. In any language 
of the world Brand, Peer Gynt, and 
Emperor or Galilean prove their author 
a thinker of extraordinary penetration, 
and a moralist of international influence. 
Turn from them to To be or not to be, 
or The seven ages of man, and imagine, 
if you can, anybody more critical than 
a village schoolmaster being imposed on 
by such platitudinous fudge. The com- 
parison does not honor Ibsen: it makes 
Shakespear ridiculous; and for both 
their sakes it should not be drawn. If 
we cannot for once leave the poor Bard 
alone, let us humbly apologize to Ibsen 
for our foolish worship of a foolish col- 


150 


lection of shallow proverbs in blank 
verse. Let us plead that if we compare, 
not the absolute Shakespear with the 
absolute Ibsen, but the advance from 
the old stage zany Hamblet to our 
William’s Hamlet with the advance 
from Faust to Peer Gynt, Ham- 
let was really a great achievement, 
and might stand as an isolated feat 
against Peer Gynt as an isolated feat. 
But as it led to nothing, whereas Peer 
Gynt led to so much that it now ranks 
only as part of I[bsen’s romantic wild 
oats—above all, as Ibsen’s message 
nerved him to fight all Europe in the 
teeth of starvation, whereas Shake- 
spear’s was not proof even against the 
ignorance and vulgarity of the London 
playgoer, it only needs another turn of 
the discussion to shew that a comparison 
of the two popular masterpieces is like 
a comparison of the Eiffel Tower to 
one of the peaks in an Alpine chain.

ea DON JUAN. This creature Man, 
who in his own selfish affairs ts a 
coward to the backbone, will fight for 
an idea like a hero. He may be abject 
as a citizen; but he is dangerous as a 
fanatic. He can only be enslaved whilst 
he 1s spiritually weak enough to listen to 
reason. I tell you, gentlemen, if you 
can shew a man a piece of what he now 
calls God’s work to do, and what he 
will later on call by many new names, 
you can make him entirely reckless of 
the consequences to himself personally. 
Man and Superman, p. 111. 


DON JUAN. Every idea for which Man 
will die will be a Catholic idea. When 
the Spaniard learns at last that he is no 
better than the Saracen, and his prophet 
no better than Mahomet, he will arise, 
more Catholic than ever, and die on a 
barricade across the filthy slum he 
starves in, for universal liberty and 
equality. 
THE STATUE. Bosh! 

152 


DON JUAN. What you call bosh is the 
only thing men dare die for. Later on, 
Liberty will not be Catholic enough: 
men will die for human perfection, to 
which they will sacrifice all their liberty 
gladly. 

THE DEVIL. Ay: they will never be at 
a loss for an excuse for killing one an- 
other. 

DON JUAN. What of that! It is not 
death that matters, but the fear of 
death. It is not killing and dying that 
degrades us, but base living, and accept- 
ing the wages and profits of degrada- 
tion. Man and Superman, p. 110.

A® Man grows through the ages, he 

finds himself bolder by the growth 
of his spirit (if I may so name the un- 
known) and dares more and more to 
love and trust instead_of to fear and 
fight. But his courage has other ef- 
fects: he also raises himself from mere 
consciousness to knowledge by daring 


153 


Ideals 


more and more to face facts and tell 
himself the truth. For in his infancy 
of helplessness and terror he could not 
face the inexorable; and facts being of 
all things the most inexorable, he masked 
all the threatening ones as fast as he 
discovered them; so that now every 
mask requires a hero to tear it off. The 
King of terrors, Death, was the Arch- 
Inexorable: Man could not bear the 
dread of that thought. He must per- 
suade himself that Death could be pro- 
pitiated, circumvented, abolished. How 
he fixed the mask of immortality on the 
face of Death for this purpose we all 
know. And he did the like with all dis- 
agreeables as long as they remained 
inevitable. Otherwise he must have 
gone mad with terror of the grim shapes 
around him, headed by the skeleton with 
the scythe and hourglass. The masks 
were his ideals, as he called them; and © 
what, he would ask, would life be with- | 
out ideals? Thus he became an ideal- 
ist, and remained so until he dared to , 


f 
} 


154 


begin pulling the masks off and looking 
the spectres in the face—dared, that its, 
to be more and more a realist. But all 
men are not equally brave; and the 
greatest terror prevailed whenever some 
realist bolder than the rest laid hands 
on a mask which they did not yet dare 
to do without. 

We have plenty of these masks round 
us still—some of them more fantastic 
than any of the Sandwich Islanders’ 
masks in the British Museum. In our 
novels and romances especially we see 
the most beautiful of all the masks— 
those devised to disguise the brutalities 
of the sexual instinct in the earlier stages 
of its development, and to soften the 
rigorous aspect of the iron laws by 
which Society regulates its gratification.

The realist at last loses patience with 
ideals altogether, and sees in them only 
something to blind us, something to 
numb us, something whereby, instead of 
resisting death, we can disarm it by 
committing suicide. The idealist, who 
has taken refuge with the ideals because 
he hates himself and is ashamed of 
himself, thinks that all this is so much 
the better. The realist, who has come 
to have a deep respect for himself and 
faith in the validity of his own will, 
thinks it so much the worse. To the 
one, human nature, naturally corrupt, is 
only held back from the excesses of the 
last years of the Roman Empire by self- 
denying conformity to the ideals. To 
the other, these ideals are only swad- 
dling clothes which man has outgrown, 
and which insufterably impede his move- 
ments. No wonder the two cannot 


156 


agree. The idealist says, ‘‘ Realism 
means egotism; and egotism means de- 
pravity.”’ The realist declares that 
when a man abnegates the will to live 
and be free in a world of the living and 
free, seeking only to conform to ideals 
for the sake of being, not himself, but 
‘“a good man,” then he is morally dead 
and rotten, and must be left unheeded 
to abide his resurrection, if that by good 
luck arrive before his bodily death. 
Quintessence of I[bsenism, pp. 30, 31. 


Since it is on the weaknesses of the 
higher types of character that idealism 
seizes, Ibsen’s examples of vanity, sel- 
fishness, folly and failure are not vulgar 
villains, but men who in an ordinary 
novel or melodrama would be heroes. 
His most tragic point is reached in the 
destinies of Brand and Rosmer, who 
drive those whom they love to death in 
its most wanton and cruel form. ‘The 
ordinary Philistine commits no such 
atrocities: he marries the woman he 


157 


likes, and lives more or less happily 
ever after; but that is not because he is 
greater than Brand or Rosmer, but be- 
cause he is less. ‘The idealist is a more 
dangerous animal than the Philistine 
just as a man is a more dangerous ani- 
mal than a sheep. ‘Though Brand vir- 
tually murdered his wife, I can under- 
stand many a woman, comfortably 
married to an amiable Philistine, read- 
ing the play and envying the victim her 
husband. For when Brand’s wife, hav- 
ing made the sacrifice he has exacted, 
tells him that he was right; that she is 
happy now; that she sees God face to 
face—but reminds him that ‘‘ whoso 
sees Jehovah dies,” he instinctively 
clasps his hands over her eyes; and that 
action raises him at once far above the 
criticism that sneers at idealism from 
beneath, instead of surveying it from the 
clear ether above, which can only be | 
reached through its mists. Quintessence

(C5 ENERATIONS of shallow critics, 

mostly amateurs, have laughed at 
Partridge for admiring the King in 
Hamlet more than Hamlet himself 
(with Garrick in the part), because 
“any one could see that the King was 
an actor.’’ But surely Partridge was 
right. He went to the theatre to see, 
not a real limited monarch, but a stage 
king, speaking as Partridges like to 
hear a king speaking, and able to have 
people’s heads cut off, or to brow-beat 
treason from behind an invisible hedge 
of majestically asserted divinity. Field- 
ing misunderstood the matter because in 
a world of Fieldings there would be 
neither kings nor Partridges. It is all 
very well for Hamlet to declare that the 
business of the theatre is to hold the 
mirror up to nature. He is allowed 
to do it out of respect for the bard, Just 
as he is allowed to say to a minor actor, 
‘Do not saw the air thus,” though he 
has himself been sawing the air all the 
evening, and the unfortunate minor ac-

tor has hardly had the chance of cutting 
a chip off with a penknife. But every- 
body knows perfectly well that the func- 
tion of the theatre is to realize for the 
spectators certain pictures which their 
imagination craves for, the said pictures 
being fantastic as the dreams of Alnas- 
char. Nature is only brought in as an 
accomplice in the illusion: for example, 
the actress puts rouge on her cheek in- 
stead of burnt cork because it looks 
more natural; but the moment the illu- 
sion is sacrificed to nature, the house is 
up in arms and the play is chivied from 
the stage. I began my own dramatic 
career by writing plays in which I faith- 
fully held the mirror up to nature. 
They are much admired in private read- 
ing by social reformers, industrial in- 
vestigators, and revolted daughters; but 
on one of them being rashly exhibited 
behind the footlights, it was received 
with a paroxysm of execration, whilst 
the mere perusal of the others induces 
loathing in every person, including my- 


160 


self, in whom the theatrical instinct flour- 
ishes in its integrity. Shakespear 
made exactly one attempt, in Troilus and 
Cressida, to hold the mirror up to na- 
ture; and he probably nearly ruined him- 
self by it. The Saturday Review, 7th

HAT is all this growing love of 

pageantry, this effusive loyalty, 
this officious rising and uncovering at 
a wave from a flag or a_ blast 
from a brass band? Imperialism? 
Not a bit of it. Obsequiousness, 
servility, cupidity roused by the pre- 
vailing smell of money. When Mr. 
Carnegie rattled his millions in his 
pockets all England became one rapa- 
cious cringe. Only, when Rhodes (who 
had probably been reading my Socialism 
for Millionaires) left word that no idler 
was to inherit his estate, the bent backs 
straightened mistrust fully for a mo- 
ment. Could it be that the Diamond 
King was no gentleman after all?

Now for England’s share of warning. 
Let her look to her Empire; for unless 
she makes it such a Federation for civil 
strength and defence that all free peo- 
ples will cling to it voluntarily, it will 
inevitably become a military tyranny to 
prevent them from abandoning it; and 
such a tyranny will drain the English 
taxpayer of his money more effectually 
than its worst cruelties can ever drain 
its victims of their liberty. A political 
scheme that cannot be carried out except 
by soldiers will not be a permanent one.

fers another man is a purely apologetic 
one; though I observe that on the stage 
he seems to take it for granted that he 
is an injured person as well as an unfor- 
tunate one. No doubt my moral sense 
has not been properly trained on such 
points; so possibly I shall alter my opin-

gorge rose at the Tappertitian vulgarity

relief when the scene ended with a fine 
old Richard the Third effect of Arthur 
leading his mail-clad knights off to bat-

Christianity and Mohammedanism, once

Englishman who is a Christian because 
he was born in Clapham would be a 
Mahometan for the cognate reason if he 
had been born in Constantinople. He 
has never willingly tolerated immorality. 
He did not adopt any innovation until 
it had become moral; and then he adopt- 
ed it, not on its merits, but solely be- 
cause it had become moral. In doing so 
he never realized that it had ever been 
immoral; consequently its early strug- 
gles taught him no lesson; and he has 
opposed the next step in human progress 
as indignantly as if neither manners, cus-

One of the evils of the pretence that our 
institutions represent abstract principles 
of justice instead of being mere social 
scaffolding is that persons of a certain 
temperament take the pretence seriously, 
and, when the law is on the side of in- 
justice, will not accept the situation, and 
are driven mad by their vain struggle 
against it. Dickens has drawn the type 
in his Man from Shropshire in Bleak 
House. Most public men and all law- 
yers have been appealed to by victims of 
this sense of injustice—the most unhelp- 
able of afflictions in a society like ours.

‘T° say that fashions change more rap- 

idly than men is a very crude state- 
ment of extremes. Everything has its 
own rate of change. Fashions change 
more quickly than manners, manners 
more quickly than morals, morals more 
quickly than passions, and, in general, 
the conscious, reasonable, intellectual life 
more quickly than the instinctive, wilful, 


170 


affectionate one. The dramatist who 
deals with the irony and humour of the 
relatively durable sides of life, or with 
their pity and terror, is the one whose 
comedies and tragedies will last longest 
—sometimes so long as to lead a book- 
struck generatior. to dub him “ Immor- 
tal,” and proclaim him as “not for an 
age, but for all time.’ Fashionable 
dramatists begin to “ date,’’ as the crit- 
ics call it, in a few years: the accusation 
is rife at present against the earlier plays 
of Pinero and Grundy, though it is due 
to these gentlemen to observe that Shake- 
spear’s plays must have ‘‘ dated” far 
more when they were from twenty to 
a hundred years old than they have done 
since the world gave up expecting them 
to mirror the passing hour. When Caste 
and Diplomacy were fresh, London As- 
surance had begun to date most horri- 
bly: nowadays Caste and Diplomacy 
date like the day before yesterday’s 
tinned salmon; whereas if London As- 
Surance were revived (and I beg that 


171 


nothing of the kind be attempted), there 
would be no more question of dating 
about it than about the plays of Gar- 
rick or Tobin or Mrs. Centlivre. 

But now observe the consequences, as 
to this dating business, of the fact that 
morals change more slowly than cos- 
tumes and manners, and instincts and 
passions than morals. It follows, does 
it not, that every ‘‘ immortal ”’ play will 
run the following course. First, like 
London Assurance its manners and fash- 
ions wili begin to date. If its matter is 
deep enough to tide it over this danger, 
it will come into repute again, like the 
comedies of Sheridan or Goldsmith, as 
a modern classic. But after some time | 
—some centuries, perhaps—it will begin 

to date again in point of its ethical con- | 
ception. Yet if it deals so powerfully | 
with the instincts and passions of hu- | 
manity as to survive this also, it will 

again regain its place, this time as an an- 

tique classic, especially if it tells a capital | 
story. It is impossible now to read, with- |

out a curdling of the blood and a bris- 
tling of the hair, the frightful but dra- 
matically most powerful speech which 
David, on his deathbed, delivers to his 
son about the old enemy whom he had 
himself sworn to spare. ‘“‘ Thou art a 
wise man and knowest what thou ought- 
est to do unto him; but his hoar head 
bring thou down to the grave with 
blood.”’ Odysseus, proud of outwitting 
all men at cheating and lying, and in- 
tensely relishing the blood of Penelope’s 
suitors, is equally outside our morality. 
So is Punch. But David and Ulysses, 
like Punch and Judy, will survive for 
many a long day yet. Not until the 
change has reached our instincts and 
passions will their stories begin to 
“ date”’ again for the last time before 
their final obsolescence.

Pl 
HERE is no reason why life as we Mr. Henry 
find it in Mr. James’s novels—life, Movels™ 

that is, in which passion is subordinate 


173 


to intellect and to fastidious artistic taste 
—should not be represented on the stage. 
If it is real to Mr. James, it must be 
real to others; and why should not these 
others have their drama instead of being 
banished from the theatre (to the thea- 
tre’s great loss) by the monotony and 
vulgarity of drama in which passion is 
everything, intellect nothing, and art 
only brought in by the incidental out- 
rages upon it. As it happens, I am not 
myself in Mr. James’s camp; in all the 
life that has energy enough to be inter- 
esting to me, subjective volition, passion, 
will, make intellect the merest tool. But 
there is in the centre of that cyclone a 
certain calm spot where cultivated ladies 
and gentlemen live on independent in- 
comes or by pleasant artistic occupa- 
tions. It is thcre that Mr. James’s art 
touches life, selecting whatever is grace- 
ful, exquisite, or dignified in its serenity. 
It is not life as imagined by the pit or 
gallery, or even by the stalls: it is, let 
us say, the ideal of the balcony; but 


174 


that is no reason why the pit and gallery 
should excommunicate it on the ground 
that it has no blood and entrails in it, 
and have its sentence formulated for it 
by the fiercely ambitious and wilful pro- 
fessional man in the stalls. The whole 
case against its adequacy really rests on 
its violation of the cardinal stage con- 
vention that love is the most irresistible 
of all the passions. Since most people 
go to the theatre to escape from reality, 
this convention is naturally dear to a 
world in which love, all powerful in the 
secret, unreal, day-dreaming life of the 
imagination, is in the real active life the 
abject slave of every trifling habit, preju- 
dice, and cowardice, easily stifled by 
shyness, class feeling, and pecuniary pru- 
dence, or diverted from what is theatri- 
cally assumed to be its hurricane course 
by such obstacles as a thick ankle, a 
cockney accent, or an unfashionable hat.

John 

Bunyan and 

William 
‘Shakespear 


HEN I saw a stage version of The 
Pilgrim’s Progress announced for 
production, I shook my head, knowing 
that Bunyan is far too great a dramatist 
for our theatre, which has never been 
resolute enough even in its lewdness and 
venality to win the respect and interest 
which positive, powerful wickedness al- 
ways engages, much less the services of 
men of heroic conviction. Its greatest 
catch, Shakespear, wrote for the theatre 
because, with extraordinary artistic pow- 
ers, he understood nothing and believed 
nothing. ‘Thirty-six big plays in five 
blank verse acts and (as Ruskin, I think, 
once pointed out) not a single hero! 
Only one man in them all who believes 
in life, enjoys life, thinks life worth liv- 
ing, and has a sincere, unrhetorical tear 
dropped over his deathbed; and that 
man—Falstaff! What a crew they are 
—these Saturday to Monday athletic 
stockbroker Orlandos, these villains, 
fools, clowns, drunkards, cowards, in- 
triguers, fighters, lovers, patriots, hypo- 


176 


chondriacs who mistake themselves (and 
are mistaken by the author) for philoso- 
phers, princes without any sense of pub- 
lic duty, futile pessimists who imagine 
they are confronting a barren and un- 
meaning world when they are only con- 
templating their own worthlessness, self- 
seekers of all kinds, keenly observed and 
masterfully drawn from the romantic- 
commercial point of view. Once or 
twice we scent among them an antici- 
pation of the crudest side of Ibsen’s 
polemics on the Woman Question, as in 
All’s Well that Ends Well, where the 
man cuts as meanly selfish a figure be- 
side his enlightened lady doctor wife as 
Helmer beside Nora; or in Cymbeline, 
where Posthumus, having, as he be- 
lieves, killed his wife for inconstancy, 
speculates for a moment on what his 
life would have been worth if the same 
standard of continence had been applied 
to himself. And certainly no modern 
study of the voluptuous temperament, 
and the spurious heroism and heroinism 


177 


which its ecstasies produce, can add 
much to Antony and Cleopatra, unless 
it were some sense of the spuriousness 
on the author’s part. But search for 
statesmanship, or even citizenship, or 
any sense of the commonwealth, material 
or spiritual, and you will not find the 
making of a decent vestryman or curate 
in the whole horde. As to faith, hope, 
courage, conviction, or any of the true 
heroic qualities, you find nothing but 
death made sensational, despair made 
stage sublime, sex made romantic, and 
barrenness covered up by sentimentality 
and the mechanical lilt of blank verse. 
All that you miss in Shakespear you find 
in Bunyan, to whom the true heroic came 
quite obviously and naturally. The 
world was to him a more terrible place 
than it was to Shakespear; but he saw 
through it a path at the end of which 
a man might look not only forward to 
the Celestial City, but back on his life 
and say:—‘‘ Tho’ with great difficulty 


178 


I am got hither, yet now I do not re- 
pent me of all the trouble I have been 
at to arrive where I am. My sword I 
give to him that. shall succeed me in 
my pilgrimage, and my courage and 
Sail to him that can get it.” The heart 
vibrates like a bell to such an utterance 
as this: to turn from it to ‘‘ Out, out, 
brief candle,” and ‘‘ The rest is silence,”’ 
and ‘‘ We are such stuff as dreams are 
made of; and our little life is rounded 
by a sleep” is to turn from life, 
strength, resolution, morning air and 
eternal youth, to the terrors of a drunk- 
en nightmare. 

Let us descend now to the lower ground 
where Shakespear is not disabled by his 
inferiority in energy and elevation of 
spirit. Take one of his big fighting 
scenes, and compare its blank verse, in 
point of mere rhetorical strenuousness, 
with Bunyan’s prose. Macbeth’s fa- 
mous cue for the fight with Macduff 
runs thus :— 


179 


Yet I will try the last: before my body 

I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, 
Macduff, 

And damned be him that first cries, 
Hold, enough! 


Turn from this jingle, dramatically right 
in feeling, but silly and resourceless in 
thought and expression, to Apollyon’s 
cue for the fight in the Valley of Humili- 
ation: ‘‘ | am void of fear in this matter. 
Prepare thyself to die; for I swear by 
my infernal den that thou shalt go no 
farther: here will I spill thy soul.” This 
is the same thing done masterly. Apart 
from its superior grandeur, force, and 
appropriateness, it is better claptrap and 
infinitely better word music. 

Shakespear, fond as he is of describ- 
ing fights, has hardly ever sufficient 
energy or reality of imagination to finish 
without betraying the paper origin of 
his fancies by dragging in something 
classical in the style of the Cyclops’ ham- 
mer falling ‘‘on Mars’s armor, forged 


180° 


for proof eterne.”” Hear how Bunyan 
does it: ‘I fought till my sword did 
cleave to my hand; and when they were 
joined together as if, the sword grew out 
of my arm; and when the blood ran 
thorow my fingers, then I fought with 
most courage.’ Nowhere in all Shake- 
spear is there a touch like that of the 
blood running down through the man’s 
fingers, and his courage rising to passion 
at it. Even in mere technical adaptation 
to the art of the actor, Bunyan’s dra- 
matic speeches are as good as Shake- 
spear’s tirades. Only a trained dramatic 
speaker can appreciate the terse man- 
ageableness and effectiveness of such a 
speech as this, with its grandiose exor- 
dium, followed up by its pointed ques- 
tion and its stern threat: ‘“‘ By this I 
perceive thou art one of my subjects; 
for all that country is mine and [ am the 
Prince and the God of it. How is it 
then that thou hast ran away from thy 
King? Were it not that I hope thou 
mayst do me more service [ would strike 


181 


thee now at one blow to the ground.” 
Here there is no raving and swearing 
and rhyming and classical allusion. The 
sentences go straight to their mark; and 
their concluding phrases soar like the 
sunrise, or swing and drop like a ham- 
mer, just as the actor wants them. 

I might multiply these instances by the 
dozen; but I had rather leave dramatic 
students to compare the two authors at 
first hand. In an article on Bunyan 
lately published in the Contemporary 
Review—the only article worth reading 
on the subject I ever saw (yes, thank 
you: I am quite familiar with Macau- 
lay’s patronizing prattle about The Pil- 
grim’s Progress) Mr. Richard Heath, 
the historian of the Anabaptists, shows 
how Bunyan learnt his lesson, not only 
from his own rough pilgrimage through 
life, but from the tradition of many an 
actual journey from real Cities of De- 
struction (under Alva), with Inter- 
preters’ houses and convoy of Great- 
hearts all complete. Against such a man 


182 


what chance had our poor immortal 
William, with his “ little Latin’ (would 
it had been less like his Greek!), his 
heathen mythology, his Plutarch, his Boc- 
caccio, his Holinshed, his circle of Lon- 
don literary wits, soddening their minds 
with books and their nerves with alcohol 
(quite like us), and all the rest of his 
Strand and Fleet Street surroundings, 
activities and interests, social and profes- 
sional, mentionable and unmentionable? 
Let us applaud him, in due measure, 
in that he came out of it no black- 
guardedly Bohemian, but a thoroughly 
respectable snob; raised the desperation 
and cynicism of its outlook to something 
like sublimity in his tragedies; drama- 
tized its morbid, self-centred passions 
and its feeble and shallow speculations 
with all the force that was in them; dis- 
infected it by copious doses of romantic 
poetry, fun, and common-sense; and gave 
to its perpetual sex-obsession the relief 
of individual character and feminine win- 
someness. Also—if you are a_ sufh-

ciently good Whig—that after incarnat- 
ing the spirit of the whole epoch which 
began with the sixteenth century and is 
ending (I hope) with the nineteenth, he 
is still the idol of all well-read children. 
But as he never thought a noble life 
worth living or a great work worth 
doing, because the commercial profit and 
loss sheet shewed that the one did not 
bring happiness nor the other money, 
he never struck the great vein—the vein 
in which Bunyan told of that “‘ man of 
a very stout countenance’’ who went 
up to the keeper of the book of life 
and said, not ‘‘ Out, out, brief candle,” 
but “ Set down my name, sir,’ and im- 
mediately fell on the armed men and 
cut his way into heaven after receiving 
and giving many wounds. The Satur- 
day Review, 2nd _Januany 1897. 


Wiis: Pokal You have seen 
severed heads before, Cesar, and 
severed right hands too, I think; some 
thousands of them, in Gaul, after you 


184 


vanquished Vercingetorix. Did you 
spare him, with all your clemency? Was 
that vengeance? 
C#SAR. No, by the Gods! would that 
it had been! Vengeance at least is hu- 
man. No, I say: those severed right 
hands and the brave Vercingetorix basely 
strangled in a vault beneath the Capitol, 
were [with shuddering satire] a wise se- 
verity, a necessary protection to the com- 
monwealth, a duty of statesmanship— 
follies and fictions ten times bloodier 
than honest vengeance! What a fool 
was I then! To think that men’s lives 
should be at the mercy of such fools! 
Cesar and Cleopatra, pp. 123, 124.

Wat people call goodness has to 
be kept in check just as carefully 
as what they call badness; for the human 
constitution will not stand very much of 
either without serious psychological mis- 
chief, ending in insanity or crime. The 
fact that the insanity may be privileged, 
as Savonarola’s was, up to the point of 


185 


Laodi- 
ceanism 


wrecking the social life of Florence, 
does not alter the case. We always hesi- 
tate to treat a dangerously good man as 
a lunatic because he may turn out to be 
a prophet in the true sense: that is, a 
man of exceptional sanity who is in the 
right when we are in the wrong. How- 
ever necessary it may have been to get 
rid of Savonarola, it was foolish to poi- 
son Socrates and burn St. Joan of Arc. 
But it is none the less necessary to take 
a firm stand against the monstrous prop- 
osition that because certain attitudes and 
sentiments may be heroic and admirable 
at some momentous crisis, they should or 
can be maintained at the same pitch con- 
tinuously through life. A life spent in 
prayer and almsgiving is really as in- 
sane as a life spent in cursing and pick- 
ing pockets: the effect of everybody lead- 
ing it would be equally disastrous. 
Getting Married, pp. 137, 138. 


Ethical strain is just as bad for us as 
physical strain. It is desirable that the 


186 


normal pitch of conduct at which men 
are not conscious of being particularly 
virtuous, although they feel mean when 
they fall below it, should be raised as 
high as possible; but it is not desirable 
that they should attempt to live con- 
stantly above this pitch any more than 
that they should habitually walk at the 
rate of five miles an hour, or carry a 
hundredweight continually on their 
backs. ‘Their normal condition should 
be in nowise difficult or remarkable; and 
it is a perfectly sound instinct that leads 
us to mistrust the good man as much as 
the bad man, and to object to the clergy- 
man who is pious extra-professionally as 
much as to th: professional pugilist who 
is quarrelsome and violent in private life. 
We do not want good men and bad men 
any more than we want giants and 
dwarfs. What we do want is a high 
quality for our normal: that is, people 
who can be much better than what we 
now call respectable without self-sacri- 
fice. Conscious goodness, like conscious

muscular effort, may be of use in emer- 
gencies; but for everyday national use 
it is negligible; and its eftect on the char- 
acter of the individual may easily be 
disastrous. Getting Married, pp. 138,

[N a developing civilization nothing 
can make laws tolerable unless their 
changes and modifications are kept as 
closely as possible on the heels of the 
changes and modifications in social con- 
ditions which development involves. 
Also there is a bad side to the very 
convenience of law. It deadens the con- 
science of individuals by relieving them 
of the ethical responsibility of their own 
actions. The Sanity of Art. p. 52. 


Law is never so necessary as when it has 
no ethical significance whatever, and is 
pure law for the sake of law. ‘The law 
that compels me to keep to the left when 
driving along Oxford Street is ethically 
senseless, as is shewn by the fact that 
keeping to the right answers equally well 


188 


in Paris; and it certainly destroys my 
freedom to choose my side; but by en- 
abling me to count on every one else 
keeping to the left also, thus making 
traffic possible and safe, it enlarges my 
life and sets my mind free for nobler 
issues, The Sanity of Art, p. 48. 


The continual danger to liberty created 
by law arises, not from the encroach- 
ments of Governments, which arealways 
regarded with suspicion, but from the 
immense utility and consequent popu- 
larity of law, and the terrifying danger 
and obvious inconvenience of anarchy; 
so that even pirates appoint and obey a 
captain. Jaw soon acquires such a good 
character that people will believe no evil 
of it; and at this point it becomes pos- 
sible for priests and rulers to commit 
the most pernicious crimes in the name 
of law and order. 

The Sanity of Art, p. 51. 


Godhead, face to face with Stupidity, 
must compromise. Unable to enforce on 


189 


the world the pure law of thought, it 
must resort to a mechanical law of com- 
mandments to be enforced by brute pun- 
ishments and the destruction of the dis- 
obedient. And however carefully these 
laws are framed to represent the highest 
thoughts of the framers at the moment 
of their promulgation, before a day has 
elapsed that thought has grown and 
widened by the ceaseless evolution of 
life; and lo! yesterday’s law already 
fallen out with today’s thought. Yet 
if the high givers of that law themselves 
set the example of breaking it before it 
is a week old, they destroy all its author- 
ity with their subjects, and so break the 
weapon they have forged to rule them 
for their own good. ‘They must there- 
fore maintain at all costs the sanctity 
of the law, even when it has ceased to 
represent their thought; so that at last 
they get entangled in a network of or- 
dinances which they no longer believe in, 
and yet have made so sacred by custom 
and so terrible by punishment, that they 


190

cannot themselves escape from them. 
Thus Wotan’s resort to law finally costs 
him half the integrity of his godhead— 
as if a spiritual king, to gain temporal 
power, had plucked out one of his eyes 
—and at last he begins secretly to long 
for the advent of some power higher 
than himself which will destroy his arti- 
ficial empire of law, and establish a true 

republic of free thought.

ODERN civilization is reduced to 
absurdity by obvious and mon- 
strous inequalities and injustices in the 
distribution of wealth and the encour- 
agement of labor. ‘The well-to-do-man 
ascribes these to inequalities of charac- 
ter, to improvidence, intemperance and 
laziness being beaten in the race by 
thrift, sobriety and industry. The poor 
man pleads that he is unlucky. Both will 
tell you that if an equal distribution of 
goods were made now, all the present 
inequalities would presently reappear.

The Law 
of Rent 


This is quite true, and would be equally | 
true if the equal distribution of goods | 
were accompanied by an equal and per- | 
manent distribution of character. Char- 
acter is a negligible factor in the busi- | 
ness. he real importance of the law | 
of rent is that it shews how the govern- 
ing factor in the distribution of wealth 
is not the individual human producer, 
but the material at his disposal and the 
place in which he works. Faculty is tol- 
erably equally divided; but soils and 
situations vary enormously. And so in 
the course of time the proprietors of the 
better soils and the masters of the better 
situations become rich without working 
at all, and accumulate spare money. 
And spare money, according to the 
terse and perfect definition of Jevons, is 
capital: the most important of all the 
factors in production nowadays. ‘This 
science of rent is the foundation of mod- 
ern economic socialism, the greatest 
revolutionary force of your time. Life,

ATIONALLY considered, life 1s 
only worth living when its pleasures 

are greater than its pains. Now to a 
generation which has ceased to believe in 
heaven, and has not yet learned that the

every five of its number is artificial and 
remediable, the fact that life is not worth

living is obvious. Is is useless to pre- 


tend that the pessimism of Koheleth, | 
Shakespear, Dryden and Swift can be re-, 
futed if the world progresses solely by 
the destruction of the unfit, and yet can. 
only maintain its civilization by manu-. 
facturing the unfit in swarms of which 
that appalling proportion of four to one 
represents but the comparatively fit sur- 
vivors. Plainly, then, the reasonable 
thing for the rationalists to do’ is to’ 
refuse to live. But as none of them will 
commit suicide in obedience to this dem- 
onstration of “the necessity’ for it, 
there is an end of the notion that we live 
for reasons instead of in fulfilment of 
our will to live.

Demonstrate to me that life is relig-

It was not the Churches but that very 
freethinking philosopher Schopenhauer 
who re-established the old theological 
doctrine that reason is no motive power; 
that the true motive power in the world 
is will (otherwise Life); and that the 
setting-up of reason above will is a dam- 
nable error. But the theologians could 
not open their arms to Schopenhauer, be- 
cause he fell into the Rationalist-Mer- 
cantilist error of valuing life according 
to its individual profits in pleasure, and 
of course came to the idiotic pessimist 
conclusion that life is not worth living, 
and that the will which urges us to live 
in spite of this is necessarily a malign 
torturer, or at least a bad hand at busi- 
ness, the desirable end of all things being 


195 


the Nirvana of the stilling of the will 
and the consequent setting of life’s

sense, the pessimism, the rationalism, the 
supernatural theology, and all the other 
subterfuges to which we cling because we 
are afraid to look life straight in the 
face and see in it, not the fulfilment of 


a moral law or of the deductions of rea- 


son, but the satisfaction of a passion in 


us of which we can give no rational ac- 


count whatever. 


It is natural for man to shrink from the 


terrible responsibility thrown on him by 
this inexorable fact. 


The Sanity of Art, pp. 57, 58. 


I suggest to you that the reason why we — 


go on striving to understand life better 
instead of confining ourselves to mere 
pleasure hunting, is that this mysterious 


force behind us—I will call it the Life

organ of intelligent consciousness; and

orate experiment in the evolution of such 
an organ. Life, Literature and Politi-

view, January 1906, p. 28. 


Do you see that the reason you will de- 
cide to continue living is that you have 
in hand the pressing business of conquer- 
ing for the Life Force a larger,

hensive consciousness: in short to enable

DON JUAN. Man gives every reason 
for his conduct save one, every excuse 
for his crimes save one, every plea for 
his safety save one; and that one is his 
cowardice. Yet all his civilization is 
founded on his cowardice, on his abject 
tameness, which he calls his respectabil- 
ity. There are limits to what a mule

or an ass will stand; but Man will suffer 
himself to be degraded until his vileness 
becomes so loathsome to his oppressors 
that they themselves are forced to re-

THE DEVIL. Precisely. And these are 
the creatures in whom you discover what 
you call a Life Force! 


DON JUAN. Yes; for now comes the 
most surprising part of the whole busi- 
ness. 


THE STATUE. What’s that? 


DON JUAN. Why, that you can make 
any of these cowards brave by simply 
putting an idea into his head. 


THE STATUE. Stuff! As an old sol- 
dier I admit the cowardice: it’s as uni- 
versal as sea sickness, and matters just 
as little. But that about putting an idea 
into a man’s head is stuff and nonsense. 
Ina battle all you need to make you fight 
is a little hot blood and the knowledge 
that it’s more dangerous to lose than to 
win.

DON JUAN. That is perhaps why bat- 
tles are so useless. But men never really 
overcome fear until they imagine they 
are fighting to further a universal pur- 
pose—fighting for an idea, as they call it. 
Why was the Crusader braver than the 
pirate? Because he fought, not for him- 
self, but for the Cross. What force 
was it that met him with a valor as reck- 
less as his own? The force of men who 
fought, not for themselves, but for Is- 
lam.

ANA. Is there nothing in heaven but 
contemplation, Juan? 

DON JUAN. In the Heaven I seek, no 
other joy. But there is the work of 
helping Life in its struggle upward. 
Think of how it wastes and scatters it- 
self, how it raises up obstacles-to itself 
and destroys itself in its ignorance and 
blindness. It needs a brain, this irre- 
sistible force, lest in its ignorance it 
should resist itself. What a piece of 


199 


| 
work is a man! says the poet. Yes: but. 
what a blunderer! MHere is the highest 
miracle of organization yet attained by 
life, the most intensely alive thing that 
exists, the most conscious of all the or- 
ganisms; and yet, how wretched are his 
brains! Stupidity made sordid and cruel! 
by the realities learnt from toil and pov- 
erty: Imagination resolved to starve 
sooner than face these realities, piling 
up illusions to hide them, and calling it- 
self cleverness, genius! And each accus- 
ing the other of its own defect: Stupidity 
accusing Imagination of folly, and Im- 
agination accusing Stupidity of ignor- 
ance: whereas, alas! Stupidity has all 
the knowledge, and Imagination all the 
intelligence. 
Man and Superman, pp. 105, 106. 


If we could only realize that though 
the Life Force supplies us with its 
own purpose, it has no other brains to 
work with than those it has painfully 
and imperfectly evolved in our heads, 


200 


the peoples of the earth would learn 
some pity for their gods; and we should 
have a religion that would not be con- 
tradicted at every turn by the thing that 
is giving the lie to the thing that ought 
to be. 

The Irrational Knot, pp. xxv., xxvi. 


DON JUAN. I tell you that as long as I 
can conceive something better than my- 
self I cannot be easy unless I am striving 
to bring it into existence or clearing the 
way for it. That is the law of my life. 
That is the working within me of Life’s 
incessant aspiration to higher organiza- 
tion, wider, deeper, intenser self-con- 
sciousness, and clearer self-understand- 
ing. Man and Superman, p. 129. 


DON JUAN. A picture gallery is a dull 
place for a blind man. But even as you 
enjoy the contemplation of such roman- 
tic mirages as beauty and pleasure; so 
would I enjoy the contemplation of that 
which interests me above all things: 
namely, Life: the force that ever strives 


201 


to attain greater power of contemplating | 


itself. What made this brain of mine, 
do you think? Not the need to move 
my limbs; for a rat with half my brains 
moves as well as I. Not merely the 
need to do, but the need to know what 
I do, lest in my blind efforts to live 
I should be slaying myself. 

Man and Superman, p. 105. 


DON JUAN. Just as Life, after ages of 
struggle, evolved that wonderful bodily 
organ the eye, so that the living organ- 
ism could see where it was going and 
what was coming to help or threaten it, 
and thus avoid a thousand dangers that 


formerly slew it, so it is evolving to-day 


a mind’s eye that shall see, not the physi- 
cal world, but the purpose of Life, and 
thereby enable the individual to work 
for that purpose instead of thwarting 
and baffling it by setting up shortsighted 
personal aims as at present.

I HAVE a very poor opinion of Lon- London 
don in its collective capacity. It 
is alike incapable of appreciating a bene- 
fit and of resenting an outrage. For 
example, one of the finest views in the 
world is within a minute’s walk of 
Charing Cross. Go down Villiers Street 
and ascend the first stairs to your right 
after you pass the music hall. This 
brings you into the loggia attached to 
the wall of the South-Eastern terminus, 
and leading to the Hungerford foot- 
bridge. He who designed this loggia 
was no Orcagna, though he had such a 
chance as Orcagna never had in Flor- 
ence. It is a dismal square hole in a 
_mass of dirty bricks, through which men 
hurry with loathing. Yet if you look 
out through one of the holes—prefer- 
ably the last but one—made for the 
convenience of the east wind, you will 
find the view magnificent. Right into 
one of the foci of that view, London, 
without a murmur, permitted Mr. Jabez 


203 


Balfour to dump the building which is 
now the Hotel Cecil, just as it allowed 
the London Pavilion Music-hall to spoil 
Piccadilly Circus. If that building had 
darkened the smallest window of a rag 
and bone shop, the proprietor thereof 
would have been supported by all the 
might of the State in maintaining his 
** Ancient Lights.’’ But because all Lon- 
don—nay, all the world that visits Lon- 
don—was injured, there was no placard 
with “ Ancient View” on it put up in 
that grimy loggia. If the malefactor 
had confined himself to injuring the pub- 
lic collectively, he would by this time 
have been one of our most eminent citi- © 
zens. Unfortunately, he trifled with pri- 
vate property; and we instantly stretched 
out our hand to the uttermost parts of 
the earth whither he had fled; seized 
him; and cast him into prison. If the 
question had been one of beneficence in- 
stead of maleficence, we should have.

Marat and FE AN PAUL MARAT, “ people’s 
Charlotte ° 9 . 

Corday friend” and altruist par excellence, 

was a man just after our playgoers’ own 


hearts—a man whose virtue consisted in 
208 


burning indignation at the sufferings of 
others and an intense desire to see them 
balanced by an exemplary retaliation. 
That is to say, his morality was the 
morality of the melodrama, and of the 
gallery which applauds frantically when 
the hero knocks the villain down. It is 
only by coarsely falsifying Marat’s char- 
acter that he has been made into an 
Adelphi villain—nay, prevented from 
bringing down the house as an Adelphi 
hero, as he certainly would if the audi- 
ence could be shewn the horrors that pro- 
voked him and the personal disinterest- 
edness and sincerity with which he threw 
himself into a war of extermination 
against tyranny. Ibsen may have earned 
the right to prove by the example of 
such men as Marat that these virtues 
were the making of a scoundrel more 
mischievous than the most openly vi- 
cious aristocrat for whose head he clam- 
ored; but the common run of our 
playgoers will have none of Ibsen’s mo- 
rality, and as much of Marat’s as our 


209 


Marriage 


romantic dramatists can stuff them with. 
Charlotte Corday herself was simply a 
female Marat. She, too, hated tyranny 
and idealized her passionate instinct for 
bloody retaliation. There is the true 
tragic irony in Marat’s death at her 
hand: it was not really murder: it was 
suicide—Marat slain by the spirit of 
Marat. No bad theme for a playwright 
capable of handling it! The Saturday 
Review, 5th February 1898. 


’ a 
DON JUAN. Send me to the galleys 
and chain me to the felon whose 
number happens to be next to mine; and 
I must accept the inevitable and make 
the best of the companionship. Many 
such companionships, they tell me, are 
touchingly affectionate; and most are at 
least tolerably friendly. But. that does 
not make a chain a desirable ornament 
nor the galleys an abode of bliss. Those 
who talk most about the blessings of 
marriage and the constancy of its vows 
are the very people who declare that if 


210 


| 


the chain were broken and the prison- 
ers left free to choose, the whole social 
fabric would fly asunder. You cannot 
have the argument both ways. If the 
prisoner 1s happy, why lock him in? 
if he is not, why pretend that he is? 
Man and Superman, p. 122. 


However much we may all suffer through 
marriage, most of us think so little about 
it that we regard it as a fixed part of 
the order of nature, like gravitation. 
Except for this error, which may be re- 
garded as constant, we use the word with 
reckless looseness, meaning a dozen dif- 
ferent things by it, and yet always as- 
suming that to a respectable man it can 
have only one meaning. ‘The pious citi- 
zen, suspecting the Socialist (for exam- 
ple) of unmentionable things, and ask- 
ing him heatedly whether he wishes to 
abolish marriage, is infuriated by a sense 
of unanswerable quibbling when the So- 
cialist asks him what particular variety 
of marriage he means: English civil 


211 


marriage, sacramental marriage, indis- 
soluble Roman Catholic marriage, mar- 
riage of divorced persons, Scotch mar- 
riage, Irish marriage, French, German, 
Turkish, or South Dakotan marriage. 
# In Norway and Sweden, two of the most 
highly civilized countries in the world, 
a marriage is dissolved if both parties 
wish it, without any question of conduct. 
That is what marriage means in Scan- 
dinavia. In Clapham that is what they 
call by the senseless name of Free Love. 
In the British Empire we have unlimited 
Kulin polygamy, Muslim polygamy lim- 
ited to four wives, child marriages, and, 
nearer home, marriages of first cousins: 
all of them abominations in the eyes of. 
many worthy persons. Not only may the 
respectable British champion of mar- 
riage mean any of these widely different | 
institutions ; sometimes he does not mean ° 
marriage at all. He means monogamy, 
chastity, temperance, respectability, mo-: 
rality, Christianity, anti-socialism, and a. 
dozen other things that have no neces- 
212 


sary connection with marriage. He 
often means something that he dare not 
avow: ownership of the person of an- 
other human being, for instance. And 
he never tells the truth about his own 
marriage either to himself or anyone 
else. Getting Married, pp. 121, 122. 


If we adopt the common romantic as- 
sumption that the object of marriage is 
bliss, then the very strongest reason for 
dissolving a marriage is that it shall be 
disagreeable to one or other or both of 
the parties. If we accept the view that 
the object of marriage is to provide for 
the production and rearing of children, 
then childlessness should be a conclusive 
reason for dissolution. As neither of 
these causes entitles married persons to 
divorce in England, it is at once clear 
that our marriage law is not founded 
on either assumption. What it is really 
founded on is the morality of the tenth 
commandment, which Englishwomen 
will one day succeed in obliterating from 


213 


the walls of our churches by refusing 
to enter any building where they are 
publicly classed with a man’s house, his 
ox, and his ass, as his purchased chat- 
tels. Getting Married, p. 123. 


It is remarkable that the very people 
who romance most absurdly about the 
closeness and sacredness of the marriage 
tie are also those who are most convinced 
that the man’s sphere and the woman’s 
sphere are so entirely separate that only 
in their leisure moments can they ever 
be together. 

Getting Married, p. 140. 


The common notion that the existing 
forms of marriage are not political con- 
trivances, but sacred ethical obligations 
to which everything, even the very ex- 
istence of the human race must be sac- 
rificed if necessary (and this is what the 
vulgar morality we mostly profess on 
the subject comes to), is one on which 
no sane Government could act for a 
moment; and yet it influences, or is be- 


214 


lieved to influence, so many votes, that 
no Government will touch the marriage 
question if it can possibly help it. 
Getting Married, p. 142. 
The religious revolt against marriage is 
avery old one. Christianity began with 
a fierce attack on marriage; and to this 
day the celibacy of the Roman Catholic 
priesthood is a standing protest against 
its compatibility with the higher life. 
St. Paul’s reluctant sanction of marriage; 
his personal protest that he countenanced 
if of necessity and against his own con- 
viction; his contemptuous “‘ better to 
marry than to burn ” is only out of date 
in respect of his belief that the end of 
the world was at hand, and that there 
was therefore no longer any population 
question. His instinctive recoil from its 
worst aspect as a slavery to pleasure 
which induces two people to accept slav- 
ery to one another has remained an ac- 
tive force in the world to this day, and 
is now stirring more uneasily than ever. 
Getting Married, pp. 126, 127.

The 
Marriage 
Laws 


I have never met anybody really in fa- 
vor of maintaining marriage as it exists 
in England to-day. A Roman Catholic 
may obey his Church by assenting ver- 
bally to the doctrine of indissoluble 
marriage. But nobody worth counting 
believes directly, frankly, and instinct- 
ively that when a person commits a mur- 
der and ts put into prison for twenty 
years for it, the free and innocent hus- 
band or wife of that murcerer should 
remain bound by the marriage. To put) 
it briefly, a contract for better for worse) 
is a contract that should not be toler- 
ated. Getting Married, p. 122: 
—--— 

A®OUT twenty-six years ago a some- 

what similar dilemma to that in 
Mr. Esmond’s play (The Divided 
Way) arose between three persons no 
less famous than Wagner, Hans von Bu- 
low, and Liszt’s daughter, Cosima von 
Bulow. Madame von Bulow preferred 
to spend her life with Wagner, just as 
Mrs. Humeden in the play preferred to 


216 


spend her life with Gaunt. The change 
was effected with the happiest results: 
at least I am not aware that anybody 
was a penny the worse—certainly not 
Madame Wagner, who holds her court 
at Bayreuth with a dignity which many 
actual princesses might, and probably 
do, envy. Far be it from me to suggest 
anarchical violations of our marriage 
laws rather than an orderly agitation for 
constitutional reform of them in har- 
mony with the higher morality of our 
own times; but I do venture to remark 
that people who decline to carry obedi- 
ence to that law too far are at least as 
interesting dramatically as people who 
forge and murder, and that the notion 
that the consequences of such disobedi- 
ence, when carried out in good faith by 
respectable people (George Eliot, for 
example), are necessarily so awful that 
suicide is the more reasonable alterna- 
tive, is a piece of nonsense that might as 
well be dropped on the stage. No hu- 
man institution could stand the strain of 


207 


the monstrous assumptions on which our 
existing marriage laws proceed if we 
were really sincere about them; and 
though there is much to be said for our 
English method of maintaining social 
order by collectively maintaining the sa- 
credness of our moral ideals whilst we 
individually mitigate their severity by 
evasion, collusion, and never seeing any- 
thing until our attention is compelled by 
legal proceedings, yet the abuse of this 
system of toleration by people whose 
conduct we are not prepared to excuse, 
but who cannot very well be exposed if 
the excusable people are to be spared, is 
landing us in looser views than we ever 
bargained for. Already we have an 
aimlessly rebellious crusade against mar- 
riage altogether, and a curious habit of 
circumspection on the part of the experi- 
enced man of the world, who, when 
newly introduced to an English house- 
hold, picks his way very cautiously un- 
til he has ascertained whether the hus- 
band and wife really would be husband 


218 


and wife in France or Germany or South 
Dakota, and, if his conclusion is un- 
favorable, which friend of the family is 
Mr. Gaunt Humeden, so to speak. Not 
that the domestic situations which are 
not white are all necessarily jet black or 
even disagreeably grey; but the fact that 
under the English law a mistake in mar- 
riage cannot be effectively remedied ex- 
cept by the disgrace of either party—that 
is to say, cannot be remedied at all by de- 
cent people, divorce being thus a boon re- 
served for the dissolute—is continually 
producing a supply of cases not at all dis- 
similar to that which is the subject of Mr. 
Esmond’s play. Most of them are set- 
tled, not by suicide, nor by flights into 
Egypt, but by the parties drifting along, 
nobody doing anything wrong, and no- 
body doing anything right, all seeing 
enough of one another to make them con- 
tented faute de mieux, whilst maintaining 
their honor intact. Whether this custom- 
ary and convenable solution is really bet- 
ter—say in its effect on the children who 


219 


grow up observing it—than the violent 
method of open scandal and coliusory di- 
vorce, involving the public announcement 
of cruelties and adulteries which have 
never been committed, is an open ques- 
tion, not admitting of a general answer. 
Obviously, the ideal husband and wife 
who give all their affection to one an- 
other, and maintain a state of cold in- 
difference to everyone else, should be 
executed without benefit of clergy as a 
couple of heartless monopolists; for the 
idealist may be safely challenged to pro- 
duce a single instance of a thoroughly 
happy marriage in which the affection 
which makes the marriage happy does 
not extend to a wide circle of friends. 
Just as good mothers and fathers love 
all lovable children, so good wives and 
husbands love all lovable husbands and 
wives. People with this gift of heart 
are not prevented from marrying by 
Don Juan’s difficulty: they can be faith- 
ful to one without being unfaithful to all 
the rest. Unfortunately, they are no 


220 


more common than the domestic terrors 
who are utterly incapable of living with 
anybody on tolerable terms. Family 
life may mean anything between these 
two extremes, from that of the southern 
countries where the guide-book warns 
the English tourist that if he asks a man 
after his wife’s health he will probably 
be challenged to fight a duel, or that of 
the English stage, where the same evil 
construction is maintained on the same 
pretence of jealousy for private morality 
and the honor of womanhood, to the 
most cultivated sections of English and 
American society, where people think of 
our existing marriage law much as Mat- 
thew Arnold thought about Tennyson, 
and unfortunately keep their opinion tc 
themselves with equal ‘‘ good taste.” 
The practical result is, superhuman pre- 
tension, extravagant hypocrisy, toler- 
ance of every sort of misconduct—pro- 
vided it is clandestine, and, of course, a 
conspiracy of silence. The Saturday 
Review, 30th November 1895.

Marriage 
and the 
Reforma- 
tion 


WHEN the great protest of the six- 

teenth century came, and. the 
Church was reformed in several coun- 
tries, the Reformation was so largely a 
rebellion against sacerdotalism that mar- 
rlage Was very nearly excommunicated 
again, as it had been by the early Chris- 
tians: our modern civil marriage, round 
which so many fierce controversies and 
political conflicts have raged, would 
have been thoroughly approved of by 
Calvin, and hailed with relief by Luther. 
But the instinctive doctrine that there is 
something holy and mystic in sex, a doc- 
trine which many of us now easily disso- 
ciate from any priestly ceremony, but 
which in those days seemed to all who 
felt it to need a ritual affirmation, could 
not be thrown on the scrap-heap with 
the sale of Indulgences and the like; and 
so the Reformation left marriage where 
it was: a curious mixture of commercial 
sex slavery, early Christian sex abhor- 
rence, and later Christian sex sanctifica- 
tion. Getting Married, p. 196.

ATERIALISM only isolated the Materialism 
great mystery of consciousness by 
clearing away several petty mysteries 
with which we had confused it; just as 
rationalism isolated the great mystery 
of the will to live. ‘The isolation made 
both more conspicuous than before. 
We thought we had escaped for ever 
from the cloudy region of metaphysics; 
and we were only carried further into 
the heart of them. 
Quintessence of [bsenism, p. 14. 


Ibsen’s writings shew how well he knew 
the crushing weight with which the sor- 
did cares of the ordinary struggle for 
money and respectability fell on the 
world when the romance of the creeds 
was discredited, and progress seemed for 
the moment to mean, not the growth of 
the spirit of man, but an effect of the 
survival of the fittest brought about by 
the destruction of the unfit, all the most 
frightful examples of this systematic de- 
struction being thrust into the utmost 


228 


prominence by those who were fighting 
the Church with Mill’s favorite dialecti- 
cal weapon, the incompatibility of divine 
omnipotence with divine benevolence. 
His plays are full of evidence of his 
overwhelming sense of the necessity of 
rousing the individual into self-assertion 
against this numbing fatalism; and yet 
he never seems to have freed his intellect 
wholly from the acceptance of its scien- 
tific validity. That it only accounted for 
progress at all on the hypothesis of a 
continuous increase in the severity of the 
conditions of existence—that is, on an 
assumption of just the reverse of what 
was actually taking place—appears to 
have escaped Ibsen as completely as it 
has escaped Professor Huxley himself. 
It is true that he did not allow himself 
to be stopped by this gloomy fortress of 
pessimism and materialism: his genius 
pushed him past it, but without intellec- 
tually reducing it; and the result is, that 
as far as one can guess, he went on be- 
lieving it impregnable, not dreaming 
224 


that it has been demolished, and that too 
with ridiculous ease, by the mere march 
behind him of the working class, which, 
by its freedom from the characteristic 
bias of the middle classes, has escaped 
their characteristic illusions, and solved 
many of the enigmas which they found 
insoluble because they wished to find 
them so. His prophetic belief in the 
spontaneous growth of the will makes 
him a meliorist without reference to the 
operation of natural selection; but his 
impression of the light thrown by physi- 
cal and biological science on the facts of 
life seems to be the gloomy one of the 
period at which he must have received 
his education in these departments. Ex- 
ternal nature often plays her most ruth- 
less and destructive part in his works, 
which have an extraordinary fascination 
for the pessimists of that school, in spite 
of the incompatibility of his individual- 
ism with that mechanical utilitarian ethic 
of theirs which treats Man as the sport

will altogether. 
Quintessence of I[bsenism, pp. 63, 64. 
Pj 


PLATO long ago pointed out the im- 

portance of being governed by men 
with a sufficient sense of responsibility 
and comprehension of public duties to 
be very reluctant to undertake the work 
of governing; and yet we have taken 
his instruction so little to heart that we 
are at present suffering acutely from 
government by gentlemen who will 
stoop to all the mean shifts of election- 
eering and incur all its heavy expenses — 
for the sake of a seat in Parliament. 
But what our sentimentalists have not 
yet been told is that exactly the same 
thing applies to maternity as to govern- 
ment. ‘The best mothers are not those 
who are so enslaved by their primitive 
instincts that they will bear children no 
matter how hard the conditions are, but 
precisely those who place a very high 
price on their services, and are quite 


226 


prepared to become old maids if the 
price is refused, and even to feel re- 
lieved at their escape. Our democratic 
and matrimonial institutions may have 
their merits: at all events they are most- 
ly reforms of something worse; but they 
put a premium on want of self-respect 
in certain very important matters; and 
the consequence is that we are very bad- 
ly governed and are, on the whole, an 
ugly, mean, ill-bred race. Getting Mar-

OTHING is more dangerous than 

a poor doctor: not even a poor em- 

ployer or a poor landlord. The Doc- 
tor’s Dilemma, p. xc. 


It is not the fault of our doctors that 
the medical service of the community, 
as at present provided for, is a murder- 
ous absurdity. That any sane nation, 
having observed that you could provide 
for the supply of bread by giving bakers 
a pecuniary interest in baking for you, 
should go on to give a surgeon a pecun- 
iary interest in cutting off your leg, is 
enough to make one despair of political 
humanity. But that is precisely what 
we have done. And the more appalling 
the mutilation, the more the mutilator is 
paid. He who corrects the ingrowing 
toe-nail receives a few shillings: he who 
228 


cuts your inside out receives hundreds 
of guineas, except when he does it to a 
poor person for practice. 

Scandalized voices murmur that these 
operations are necessary. They may 
be. It may also be necessary to hang 
a man or pull down a house. But we 
take good care not to make the hang- 
man and the housebreaker the judges 
of that. If we did, no man’s neck 
would be safe and no man’s house stable. 
But we do make the doctor the judge, 
and fine him anything from sixpence to 
several hundred guineas if he decides 
inour favour. The Doctor’s Dilemma, 


p- V. 


Doctors are just like other Englishmen: 
most of them have no honor and no con- 
science: what they commonly mistake 
for these is sentimentality and an intense 
dread of doing anything that everybody 
else does not do, or omitting to do any- 
thing that everybody else does. ‘This 
of course does amount to a sort of work- 


229 


ing or rule-of-thumb conscience; but it 
means that you will do anything, good 
or bad, provided you get enough people 
to keep you in countenance by doing it 
also. It is the sort of conscience that 
makes it possible to keep order on a 
pirate ship, or in a troop of brigands. 

The Doctor’s Dilemma, p. viii. 


No doctor dare accuse another of mal- 
practice. He is not sure enough of his 
own opinion to ruin another man by it. 
He knows that if such conduct were 
tolerated in his profession no doctor’s 
livelihood or reputation would be worth 
a year’s purchase. Ido not blame him: 
I should do the same myself. But the 
effect of this state of things is to make 
the medical profession a conspiracy to 
hide its own shortcomings. No doubt 
the same may be said of all professions. 
They are all conspiracies against the 
laity; and I do not suggest that the 
medical conspiracy is either better or 
worse than the military conspiracy, the 


230 


legal conspiracy, the sacerdotal con- 
spiracy, the pedagogic conspiracy, the 
royal and aristocratic conspiracy, the 
literary and artistic conspiracy, and the 
innumerable industrial, commercial, and 
financial conspiracies, from the trade 
unions to the great exchanges, which 
make up the huge conflict which we call 
society. But it is less suspected. The

HERE is no more identity or neces- 
sary connection between might and 
right than between chalk and cheese. 
Every man strives for might so that his 
will may prevail; and when he attains 


234 


it his will prevails whether it is right 
or wrong. That Will, like gravitation, 
is a force in itself, is true; and that the 
human race cannot really will its own 
destruction is a thing that we may at 
least hope for on the ground that it 
manages to survive. But under the rule 
of a standard Morality evolution is lim- 
ited by the fact that at a certain point 
of development the individual in whom 
the advance is manifested (say the 
Superman) is attacked and destroyed 
in the name of Right by the other less 
developed individuals; so that in effect 
the race does will its own destruction on 
the plane of the Superman. And the 
attack presents itself to these less de- 
veloped ones as an attack of right on 
might; for to the ordinary citizen right 
means thinking as he does; and the 
Superman who goes deeper than he into 
morals is just as much a rascal to him 
as the criminal who does not go so deep. 
It seems clear, therefore, that the only 
chance for the Superman is to acquire 


235 


sufficient might to defy the efforts of 
the average respectable man to destroy 
him. Hitherto these attempts have not 
been successful on the physical plane. 
Napoleon’s military system finally re- 
duced itself to absurdity, and forced the 
dufferdom of Europe to combine and 
destroy him. Cesar, with immense so- 
cial talents and moral gifts in addition 
to moral capacity, bribed the masses into 
tolerating him, but was killed by a con- 
spiracy of “ good”’ men who killed him 
on principle as a protest of right against 
might. So much for the Superman of 
action! As to the Superman who mere- 
ly writes and talks, he escapes because 
nobody understands him. “ The tri- 
umph of his principles”? means their 
degradation to the common level, the 
mob accepting his teaching just as a 
cannibal accepts the teaching of St. John

M OXEY is indeed the most impor- 
tant thing in the world; and all 
sound and successful personal and na- 
tional morality should have this fact 
for its basis. Every teacher or twad- 
dler who denies it or suppresses it, 1s an 
enemy of life. Money controls moral- 


238 


ity; and what makes the United States 
of America look so foolish even in fool- 
ish Europe is that they are always in a 
state of flurried concern and violent in- 
terference with morality, whereas they 
throw their money into the street to be 
scrambled for, and presently find that 
their cash reserves are not in their own 
hands, but in the pockets of a few mil- 
lionaires who, bewildered by their luck, 
and unspeakably incapable of making 
any truly economic use of it, endeavor 
to ‘do good”’ with it by letting them- 
selves be fleeced by philanthropic com- 
mittee men, building contractors, libra- 
rians and professors, in the name of 
education, science, art and what not; so 
that sensible people exhale relievedly 
when the pious millionaire dies, and his 
heirs, demoralized by being brought up 
on his outrageous income, begin the so- 
cially beneficent work of scattering his 
fortune through the channels of the 
trades that flourish by riotous living.

Money is the most important thing 
in the world. It represents health, 
strength, honor, generosity and beauty 
as conspicuously and undeniably as the 
want of it represents illness, weakness, 
disgrace, meanness and ugliness. Not 
the least of its virtues is that it destroys 
base people as certainly as it fortifies 
and dignifies noble people. It is only 
when it is cheapened to worthlessness 
for some, and made impossibly dear to 
others, that it becomes a curse. In 
short, it is a curse only in such foolish 
social conditions that life itself is a 
curse. For the two things are insepar- 
able: money is the counter that enables 
life to be distributed socially: it is life 
as truly as sovereigns and bank notes 
are money. ‘The first duty of every citi- 
zen is to insist on having money on rea- 
sonable terms; and this demand 1s not 
coi iplied with by giving four men three 
shillings each for ten or twelve hours’ 
drudgery and one man a thousand 
pounds for nothing. The crying need 


240 


of the nation is not for better morals, 
cheaper bread, temperance, liberty, cul- 
ture, redemption of fallen sisters and 
erring brothers, nor the grace, love and 
fellowship of the Trinity, but simply for 
enough money. And the evil to be at- 
tacked is not sin, suffering, greed, priest- 
craft, kingcraft, demagogy, monopoly, 
ignorance, drink, war, pestilence, nor 
any of the scapegoats which reformers 
sacrifice, but simply poverty. | Major 
Barbara, p. 171.

aE 


The Irrational Knot is one of those fic- 
tions in which the morality is original 
and not readymade. Now this quality 


241 


Morality 


is the true diagnostic of the first order 
in literature and indeed in all the arts, 
including the art of life. It is, for ex- 
ample, the distinction that sets Shake- 
spear’s Hamlet above his other plays, 
and that sets Ibsen’s work as a whole 
above Shakespear’s work as a whole. 
Shakespear’s morality is a mere reach- 
me-down; and because Hamlet does not 
feel comfortable in it, and struggles 
against the misfit, he suggests something 
better, futile as his struggle is, and in- 
competent as Shakespear shews himself 
in his effort to think out the revolt of 
his feeling against readymade morality. 
Ibsen’s morality is original all through; 
he knows well that the men in the street 
have no use for principles, because they 
can neither understand nor apply them; 
and that what they can understand and 
apply are arbitrary rules of conduct, 
often frightfully destructive and inhu- 
man, but at least definite rules enabling 
the common stupid man to know where 
he stands and what he may do and not 


242 


do.without getting into trouble. Now 
to all writers of the first order, these 
rules, and the need for them produced 
by the moral and intellectual incompe- 
tence of the ordinary human animal, 
are no more invariably beneficial and re- 
spectable than the sunlight which ripens 
the wheat in Sussex and leaves the des- 
ert deadly in Sahara, making the cheeks 
of the ploughman’s child rosy in the 
morning and striking the ploughman 
brainsick or dead in the afternoon; no 
more inspired (and no less) than the 
religion of the Andaman islanders; as 
much in need of frequent throwing 
away and replacement as the commu- 
nity’s boots. By writers of the second 
order the readymade morality ts ac- 
cepted as the basis of all moral judg- 
ment and criticism of the characters 
they portray, even when their genius 
forces them to represent their most at- 
tractive heroes and heroines as violat- 
ing the readymade code in all directions. 

The Irrational Knot, pp. xxii., xxii. 


243 


No man who shuts his eyes and opens 
his mouth when religion and morality 
are offered to him on a long spoon can 
share the same Parnassian bench with 
those who make an original contribution 
to religion and morality, were it only a 
criticism. The Irrational Knot, p. xxiv. 


The statement that Ibsen’s plays have 
an immoral tendency, is, in the sense in 
which it is used, quite true. Immo- 
rality does not necessarily imply mis- 
chievous conduct: it implies conduct, 
mischievous or not, which does not con- 
form to current ideals. Since Ibsen has 
devoted himself almost entirely to shew- 
ing that the spirit or will of Man is 
constantly outgrowing his ideals, and 
that therefore conformity to them 1s 
constantly producing results no less 
tragic than those which follow the vio- 
lation of ideals which are still valid, the 


main effect of his plays is to keep before” 
the public the importance of being al-_

ways prepared to act immorally, to re- 
mind men that they ought to be as 
careful how they yield to a temptation 
to tell the truth as to a temptation to 
hold their tongues, and to urge upon 
women that the desirability of their pre- 
serving their chastity depends just as 
much on circumstances as the desirabil- 
ity of taking a cab instead of walking. 
He protests against the ordinary as- 
sumption that there are certain supreme 
ends which justify all means used to 
attain them; and insists that every end 
shall be challenged to show that it jus- 
tifies the means. Our ideals, like the 
gods of old, are constantly demanding 
human sacrifices. Let none of them, 
says Ibsen, be placed above the obliga- 
tion to prove that they are worth the 
sacrifices they demand; and let every- 
one refuse to sacrifice himself and others 
from the moment he loses his faith in 
the reality of the ideal. Quintessence 
of [bsenism, pp. 136, 137. 


245 


There can be no question as to the effect — 
likely to be produced on an individual 
by his conversion from the ordinary ac- 
ceptance of current ideals as safe stand- 
ards of conduct, to the vigilant open- 
mindedness of Ibsen. It must at once 
greatly deepen his sense of moral re- 
sponsibility. Before conversion the in- 
dividual anticipates nothing worse in the 
way of examination at the judgment bar 
of his conscience than such questions as 
Have you kept the commandments? 
Have you obeyed the law? Have you 
attended church regularly? paid your 
rates and taxes to Cesar? and con- 
tributed, in reason, to charitable insti- 
tutions? It may be hard to do all these 
things; but it is still harder not to do 
them, as our ninety-nine moral cowards 
in the hundred well know. And even a 
scoundrel can do them all and yet live 
a worse life than the smuggler or pros- 
titute who must answer No all through 
the catechism. Quintessence of Ibsen-

NAPOLEON. There are three sorts of 
people in the world, the low people, the 
middle people, and the high people. 
The low people and the high people are 
alike in one thing: they have no scruples, 
no morality. The low are beneath 
morality, the high above it. I am not 
afraid of either of them; for the low are 
unscrupulous without knowledge, so 
that they make an idol of me; whilst the 
high are unscrupulous without purpose, 
so that they go down before my will. 
Look you: I shall go over all the mobs 
and all the courts of Europe asa plough 
goes over a field. It is the middle peo- 
ple who are dangerous: they have both 
knowledge and purpose. But they, too, 
have their weak point. They are full 
of scruples—chained hand and foot by 
their morality and respectability. The

W HATEVER is contrary to estab- 

lished manners and customs is im- 
moral. An immoral act or doctrine is 


247 


Morality 
and 


Censorships 


not necessarily a sinful one: on the con- 
trary, every advance in thought and con- 
duct is by definition immoral until it has 
converted the majority. For this rea- 
son it is of the most enormous impor- 
tance that immorality should be pro- 
tected jealously against the attacks of 
those who have no standard except the 
standard of custom, and who regard 
any attack on custom—that is, on 
morals—as an attack on society, on re- 
ligion, and on virtue. 

A censor is never intentionally a protect- 
or of immorality. He always aims at 
the protection of morality. Now mo- 
rality is extremely valuable to society. 
It imposes conventional conduct on the 
great mass of persons who are incapable 
of original ethical judgment, and who 
would be quite lost if they were not in 
leading-strings devised by lawgivers, 
philosophers, prophets, and poets for 
their guidance. But morality is not de- 
pendent on censorship for protection. 
It is already powerfully fortified by the 


248 


magistracy and the whole body of law. 
Blasphemy, indecency, libel, treason, se- 
dition, obscenity, profanity, and all the 
other evils which a censorship is sup- 
posed to avert are punishable by the 
civil magistrate with all the severity of 
vehement prejudice. Morality has not 
only every engine that lawgivers can 
devise in full operation for its protec- 
tion, but also that enormous weight of 
public opinion enforced by social ostra- 
cism which is stronger than all the 
statutes. A censor pretending to protect 
morality is like a child pushing the cush- 
ions of a railway carriage to give itself 
the sensation of making the train travel 
at sixty miles an hour. It is immorality, 
not morality, that needs protection: it 
is morality, not immorality, that needs 
restraint ; for morality, with all the dead 
weight of human inertia and superstition 
to hang on the back of the pioneer, and 
all the malice of vulgarity and preju- 
dice to threaten him, is responsible for 
many persecutions and many martyr-

poor rates, police rates and sani-

in the schools flourishing and of full 
weight, whilst all the public services of 
the city are municipalized and conducted 
without a farthing of profit, or even

with occasional deficits made up out of 
the rates. Suppose another city in 
which all the public services are in the 
hands of flourishing joint stock com- 
panies paying from 7 to 21 per cent, 
and in which the workhouses, the 
prisons, the hospitals, the sanitary in- 
spectors, the disinfectors and strippers

are full of rickety children. According 
to the commercial test, the second town 
would be a triumphant proof of the 
prosperity brought by private enter- 
prise, and the first a dreadful example 
of the bankruptcy of municipal trade. 
But which town would a wise man 
rather pay rates in? The very share-

If a municipality owned all the land

The sudden reintroduction of competi-

will pay instead of the lowest. This 
tendency is clearly an anti-social one.

preciating the best sort of artistic work. 
It is even true that in every audience,» 
especially on first nights, there is an ap- 
preciable number of persons whose con- 
dition is such that—to turn Tennyson’s 
shallow claptrap into a terrible truth— 
they needs must hate the highest when 
they see it. But why should we credit 
these unhappy persons with that attri- 
bute of the highest character, the power 
of liking what pleases them, of believ- 
ing in it, of standing by those who give 
it to them? For the most part they 
never enjoy anything; they are always 
craving for stimulants, whereas the es- 
sence of art its recreation; let their flat- 
terer slip, as he always does sooner or 
later, and they are at his throat merci- 
lessly before he can recover himself. 
But 1f you speak in their hearing as the 
great men speak (which is easy enough , 
if you happen to be a great man), then 
you will find that their specialty is self- 
torture, and that they are always hank- 
ering, in spite of themselves, after their 


260 


own boredom and bewilderment, driven, 
probably, by some sort of uneasy hope 
that Ibsen or Wagner or some other 
gigantic bore may exorcize the devils 
which rend them. The fact is, there is 
nothing the public despises so much as 
an attempt to please it. “[orment is its 
natural element: it is only the saint who 
has any capacity for happiness. There 
is no greater mistake in theology than 
to suppose that it is necessary to lock 
people into hell or out of heaven. You 
might as well suppose that it is neces- 
sary to lock a professional tramp into 
a public-house or out of a Monday pop- 
ular concert, on the ground that the con- 
cert is the better and cheaper place of 
the two. The artist’s rule must be 
Cromwell’s: “ Not what they want, but 
what is good for them.” That rule, 
carried out ina kindly and sociable way, 
is the secret to success in the long run 
at the theatre as elsewhere. The Satur- 
day Review, 20th April 1895.

suddenly a civilization which has long 
ceased to think (or in the old phrase, to 
watch and pray) can fall to pieces when 
the vulgar belief in its hypocrisies and 
impostures can no longer hold out 
against its failures and scandals. When 
religious and ethical formule become so 
obsolete that no man of strong mind 
can believe them, they have also reached 
the point at which no man of high char-

N a certain sense Mr. Oscar Wilde is | 
to me our only thorough playwright. 
He plays with everything: with wit, 
with philosophy, with drama, with ac- 
tors and audience, with the whole | 
theatre. Such a feat scandalizes the | 
Englishman, who can no more play with | 
wit and philosophy than he can with a _ 
football or a cricket bat. He works at 
both, and has the consolation, if he can- | 
not make people laugh, of being the — 
best’ cricketer and footballer in the 
world. Now it is the mark of the art- 
ist that he will not work: Just as peo- 
ple with social ambitions will practise 


264 


a OO 


the meanest economies in order to live 
expensively; so thé artist will starve his 
way through incredible toil and discour- 
agement sooner than go and earn a 
week’s honest wages. Mr. Wilde, an 
arch-artist, is so colossally lazy that he 
trifles even with the work by which an 
artist escapes work. He distils the very 
quintessence, and gets as product plays 
which are so unapproachably playful 
that they are the delight of every play- 
goer with twopenn’orth of brains. The 
English critic always protesting that the 
drama should not be didactic, and yet 
always complaining if the dramatist 
does not find sermons in stones and 
good in everything, will be conscious of 
a subtle and pervading levity in An Ideal 
Husband. All the literary dignity of 
the play, all the imperturbable good 
sense and good manners with which Mr. 
Wilde makes his wit pleasant to his com- 
paratively stupid audience, cannot quite 
overcome the fact that Ireland is of all 
countries the most foreign to England, 


265 


and that to the Irishman (and Mr. 
Wilde is almost as acutely Irish an Irish- 
man as the Iron Duke of Wellington) 
there is nothing in the world quite so 
exquisitely comic as an Englishman’s 
seriousness. It becomes tragic, per- 
haps, when the Englishman acts on it; 
but that occurs too seldom to be taken 
into account, a fact which intensifies the 
humor of the situation, the total result 
being the Englishman utterly uncon- 
scious of his real self, Mr. Wilde keen- 
ly observant of it and playing on the 
self-unconsciousness with irresistible 
humor, and finally, of course, the Eng- 
lishman annoyed with himself for being 
amused at his own expense, and for be- 
ing unable to convict Mr. Wilde of 
what seems an obvious misunderstand- 
ing of human nature. He is shocked, 
too, at the danger to the foundations 
of society when seriousness is publicly 
laughed at. And to complete the odd- 
ity of the situation, Mr. Wilde, touch- 
ing what he himself reverences, is abso-

which nearly all the work is done by 
lads and lasses who are not getting a 
living wage and are yet putting in a full

Such industries are really supported by 
the young people’s parents. The young

to be guided by his passions must needs 
be a scoundrel; and the teachers who 
advise such guidance might well be slain

thrown helpless on his passions found 
that honesty, that self-respect, that 
hatred of cruelty and injustice, that the 
desire for soundness and health and 
eficiency were master passions: nay, 
that their excess is so dangerous to 
youth that it is part of the wisdom of 
age to say to the young: “ Be not right- 
eous overmuch: why shouldst thou de- 
stroy thyself?’ On the other hand, 
the people who profess to renounce and 
abjure their own passions, and ostenta- 
tiously regulate their conduct by the 
most convenient interpretation of what 
the Bible means, or, worse still, by their 
ability to find reasons for it (as if there 
were not excellent reasons to be found 
for every conceivable course of conduct, 
from dynamiting and vivisection to 
martyrdom), seldom need a warning 
against being righteous overmuch, their

attention, indeed, often needing a rather 
pressing jog in the opposite direction. 
Passion is the steam in the engine of all 
religious and moral systems. In so 
far as it is malevolent, the religions are 
malevolent too, and insist on human 
sacrifices, on hell, wrath, and vengeance.

as obvious a reality to me as magnetism

rather be misunderstood as accepting 
some of its legendary associations than 
as denying or reckoning without its ex- 
istence. But as a matter of fact, my 
references to it are always accompanied 
by other observations which could not 
possibly be taken as proceeding from 
an ordinary Evangelical. I hope to de- 
fine my views on this subject more pre- 
cisely in a book entirely devoted to 
them; but should anything prevent me 
from accomplishing this design, the

For my own part, if I do not care to 
rhapsodize much about Mozart, it is 
because I am so violently prepossessed 
in his favor that I am capable of sup- 
plying any possible deficiency in his 
work by my imagination. Gounod has 
devoutly declared that Don Giovanni 
has been to him all his life a revelation 
of perfection, a miracle, a work without 
fault. I smile indulgently at Gounod, 
since I cannot afford to give myself 
away so generously (there being, no 
doubt, less of me) ; but I am afraid my 
fundamental attitude towards Mozart 
is the same as his. In my small boy- 
hood I by good luck had an opportunity 
of learning the Don thoroughly; and if 
it were only for the sense of the value 
of fine workmanship which I gained 
from it, I should still esteem that lesson 
the most important part of my edu- 


271 


cation. Indeed it educated me artis- 
tically in all sorts of ways, and disquali- 
fied me only in one—that of criticizing 
Mozart fairly. Everyone appears a

an illusory humanity and art out of the 
effects produced by his library on his im- 
agination, build some silly systematiza- 
tion of his worthless ideas over the 
abyss of his own nescience. Such a 
philosopher is as dull and dry as you 
please: it is he who brings his profession 
into disrepute, especially when he talks 
much about art, and so persuades peo- 
ple to read him. Without having 
looked at more than fifty pictures in his 
life, or made up his mind on the small- 
est point about one of the fifty, he will 
audaciously take it upon himself to ex- 
plain the development of painting from 
Zeuxis and Apelles to Raphael. and 
Michael Angelo. As to the way he 
will go on about music, of which he al- 
ways has an awe-stricken conceit, it 
spoils my temper to think of it, espe- 
cially when one remembers that musical 
composition is taught (a monstrous 


274 


pretension) in this country by people 
who read scores, and never by any 
chance listen to performances. Now, 
the right way to go to work—strange 
as it may appear—is to look at pictures 
until you have acquired the power of 
seeing them. If you look at several 
thousand good pictures every year, and 
form some sort of practical judgment 
about every one of them—were it only 
that it is not worth troubling over— 
then at the end of five years or so you 
will, if you have a wise eye, be able to 
see what is actually in a picture, and not 
what you think is in it. Similarly, if 
you listen critically to music every day 
for a number of years, you will, if you 
have a wise ear, acquire the power of 
hearing music. And so on with all the 
arts. When we come to humanity it is 
still the same: only by intercourse with 
men and women can we learn anything 
about it. This involves an active life, 
not a contemplative one; for unless you 
do something in the world, you can have 


275 


no real business to transact with men; 
and unless you love and are loved, you 
can have no intimate relations with 
them. And you must transact business, 
wirepull politics, discuss religion, give 
and receive hate, love and friendship 
with all sorts of people before you can 
acquire the sense of humanity. If you 
are to acquire the sense sufficiently to be 
a philosopher, you must do all these 
things unconditionally. You must not 
say that you will be a gentleman and 
limit your intercourse to this class or 
that class; or that you will be a virtu- 
ous person and generalize about the af- 
fections from a single instance—unless, 
indeed, you have the rare happiness to™ 
stumble at first upon an all-enlightening 
instance. You must have no convic- 
tions, because, as Nietzsche puts it, 
‘convictions are prisons.” Thus, I 
blush to add, you cannot be a philoso- 
pher and a good man, though you may 
be a philosopher and a great one. “You 
will say, perhaps, that if this be so, there”

should be no philosophers; and perhaps 
you are right; but though I make you 
this handsome concession, I do not de- 
fer to you to the extent of ceasing to 
exist. If you insist on the hangman, 
whose pursuits are far from elevating, 
you may very well tolerate the philoso- 
pher, even if philosophy involves phi- 
landering; or, to put it another way, if, 
in spite of your hangman, you tolerate 
murder within the sphere of war, it may 
be necessary to tolerate comparatively 
venial irregularities within the sphere 
of philosophy. It is the price of 
progress ; and, after all, it is the philos- 
opher, and not you, who will burn for it.

PT HE thoughtless wickedness with 

which we scatter sentences of im- 
prisonment, torture in the solitary cell 
and on the plank bed, and flogging, on 


280 


moral invalids and energetic rebels, is 
as nothing compared to the stupid levity 
with which we tolerate poverty as if it 
were either a wholesome tonic for lazy 
people or else a virtue to be embraced 
as St. Francis embraced it. Ifa man is 
indolent, let him be poor. If he 1s 
drunken, let him be poor. If he is not 
a gentleman, let him be poor. If he is 
addicted to the fine arts or to pure 
science instead of to trade and finance, 
let him be poor. If he chooses to spend 
his urban eighteen shillings a week or 
his agricultural thirteen shillings a week 
on his beer and his family instead of 
saving-it up for his old age, let him be 
poor. Let nothing be done for “ the 
undeserving ’’: let him be poor. Serve 
him right! Also—somewhat inconsist- 
ently—blessed are the poor! Major 
Barbara, p. 166. 


The man who cannot see that starva- 
tion, overwork, dirt, and disease are as 
immoral as prostitution—that they are

merely its misfortunes—is (to put it as 
politely as possible) a hopelessly Priv- 
ate Person. The Author's Apology.— 
Mrs. Warren’s Profession, p. 54. 


. The irresistible natural truth 
which we all abhor and repudiate: to 
wit, that the greatest of evils and the 
worst of crimes is poverty, and that our 
first duty—a duty to which every other 
consideration should be sacrificed—is 
not to be poor. “ Poor but honest,” 
“the respectable poor,’ and_ such 
phrases are as intolerable and as im- 
moral as ‘“‘drunken but amiable,” 
‘fraudulent but a good after-dinner 
speaker,” “ splendidly criminal,” or the 
like. Security, the chief pretence of 
civilization, cannot exist where the 
worst of dangers, the danger of pov- 
erty, hangs over everybody’s head. 

Major Barbara, p. 164. 


At present we say callously to each citi- 
zen: ‘If you want money, earn it,”’ 


282 


if his having or not having it were a 
matter that concerned himself alone. 
We do not even secure for him the op- 
portunity of earning it: on the contrary, 
we allow our industry to be organized 
in open dependence on the maintenance 
of “a reserve army of unemployed”? 
for the sake of ‘‘ elasticity.” ‘The sen- 
sible course would be Cobden-Sander- 
son’s: that is, to give every man enough 
to live well on, so as to guarantee the 
community against the possibility of a 
case of the malignant disease of pov- 
erty, and then (necessarily) to see that 
he earned it. Major Barbara, p. 167.

CUSINS. Do you call poverty a crime? 
UNDERSHAFT. The worst of crimes. 
All the other crimes are virtues beside 
it: all the other dishonors are chivalry 
itself by comparison. Poverty blights 
whole cities; spreads horrible pest- 
lences; strikes dead the very souls of all 
who come in sight, sound or smell of it. 
What you call crime is nothing: a mur-

and a curse then: what do they matter? 
they are only the accidents and illnesses 
of life: there are not fifty genuine pro-

there are millions of poor people, ab- 
ject people, dirty people, ill fed, ill 
clothed people. They poison us mor-

with our own liberties and to organize 
unnatural cruelties for fear they should

Bur as, thanks to our political im- 

becility and personal cowardice 
(fruits of poverty, both), the best imi- 
tation of a good life now procurable is 
life on an independent income, all sen- 
sible people aim at securing such an in- 
come, and are, of course, careful to 
legalize and moralize both it and all 
the actions and sentiments which lead 
to it and support it as an institution. 
What else can they do? They know, 
of course, that they are rich because 
others are poor. But they cannot help 
that: it is.for the poor to repudiate pov- 
erty when they have had enough of it. 
The thing can be done easily enough: 
the demonstrations to the contrary 
made by the economists, jurists, moral- 
ists and sentimentalists hired by the 
rich to defend them, or even doing the 


286 


work gratuitously out of sheer folly and 
abjectness, impose only on the hirers. 

The reason why the independent income- 
tax payers are not solid in defence of 
their position is that the poverty of 
those we rob prevents our having the 
good life for which we sacrifice them. 
Rich men or aristocrats with a devel- 
oped sense of life—men like Ruskin and 
William Morris and Kropotkin—have 
enormous social appetites and very fas- 
tidious personal ones. ‘They are not 
content with handsome houses: they 
want handsome cities. They are not 
content with bediamonded wives and 
blooming daughters: they complain be- 
cause the charwoman is badly dressed, 
because the laundress smells of gin, be- 
cause the sempstress is anemic, because 
every man they meet is not a friend and

good enough for them: there is too

demand abstract conditions: justice, 
honor, a noble moral atmosphere, a

Finally they declare that though Frois- 
sart’s Knight who “ saw that to rob and 
pill was a good life’? may have been 
right, because he did it with his own 
hand on horseback and in a steel coat, 
to rob and pill by the hands of the po- 
liceman, the bailiff, and the soldier, and 
to underpay them meanly for doing it, 
is not a good life, but rather fatal to 
all possibility of even a tolerable one. 
They call on the poor to revolt, and, 
finding the poor shocked at their un- 
gentlemanliness, despairingly revile the 
proletariat for its ‘‘ damned wantless- 
ness’? (verdammte Bediirfnislosigkeit) .

I, always on the heroic plane imagin- 
atively, had two disgusting faults which 
I did not recognize as faults because I 
could not help them. I was poor and 
shabby. I therefore tolerated the gross 
error that poverty, though an incon- 
venience and a trial, is not a sin.and a- 
disgrace; and I stood for my self-re- 
spect on the things I had: probity, abil- 
ity, knowledge of art, laboriousness, 
and whatever else came cheaply to me. 
Because I could walk into Hampton 
Court Palace and the National Gallery 
(on free days) and enjoy Mantegna 
and Michael Angelo whilst millionaires 
were yawning miserably over inept 
gluttonies; because I could suffer more 
by hearing a movement of Beethoven's 
Ninth Symphony taken at a wrong 
tempo than a duchess by losing a dia- 
mond necklace, I was indifferent to the 
repulsive fact that if I had fallen in 
love with the duchess I did not possess 
a morning suit in which I could reason- 
ably have expected her to touch me with 


289 


the furthest protended pair of tongs; 
and I did not see that to remedy this I 
should have been prepared to wade 
through seas of other people’s blood. 
Indeed it is this perception which con- 
stitutes an aristocracy nowadays. It is 
the secret of all our governing classes, 
which consist finally of people who, 
though perfectly prepared to be gener- 
ous, humane, cultured, philanthropic, 
public spirited and personally charming 
in the second instance, are unalterably 
resolved, in the first, to have money 
enough for a handsome and delicate life, 
and will, in pursuit of that money, batter 
in the doors of their fellow-men, sell 
them up, sweat them in fetid dens, shoot, 
stab, hang, imprison, sink, burn and de- 
stroy them in the name of law and order. 
And this shews their fundamental sanity 
and rightmindedness; for a sufficient in- 
come is indispensable to the practice of 
virtue; and the man who will let any un- 
selfish consideration stand between him 
and its attainment is a weakling, a dupe, 


290 


and a predestined slave. If I could 
convince our impecunious mobs of this, 
the world would be reformed before the 
end of the week; for the sluggards who 
are content to be wealthy without work- 
ing and the dastards who are content to 
work without being wealthy, together 
with all the pseudo-moralists and ethi- 
cists and cowardice mongers generally, 
would be exterminated without shrift, 
to the unutterable enlargement of life 
and ennoblement of humanity. We 
might even make some beginnings of 
civilization under such happy circum- 
stances. The Irrational Knot, pp. 
XVII, XIX. 


The instinct which has led the British 
peerage to fortify itself by American al- 
liances is healthy and well inspired.

HIS is a miserably incompetent 
world. The average doctor is a 
walking compound of natural ignorance 
and acquired witchcraft, who kills your 
favourite child, wreck’s your wife’s 
health, and orders you into habits of 
nervous dram-drinking before you have 
the courage to send him about his busi- 
ness, and take your chance like a gentle- 
man. The average lawyer is a nincom- 
poop, who contradicts your perfectly 
sound impressions on notorious points 
of law, involves you in litigation when 
your case is hopeless, compromises when 
your success is certain, and cannot even 
make your will without securing the ut- 
ter defeat of your intention if any one 
takes the trouble to dispute them. . And 
so on, down to the bootmaker whose 
boots you have to make your tortured 


294 


feet fit, and the tailor who clothes you 
as if you were a cast-iron hot-water ap- 
paratus. You imagine that these people 
have professions; and you find that 
what they have is only, in the correct 
old world, their “ mystery ’’—a hum- 
bug, like all mysteries. And yet, how 
we help to keep up the humbug!

What is called professional work is, in 
point of severity, just what you choose 
to make it, either commonplace, easy, 
and requiring only extensive industry to 
be lucrative, or else distinguished, difh- 
cult, and exacting the fiercest intensive 
industry in return, after a probation of 
twenty years or so, for authority, repu- 
tation and an income only sufficient for 
simple habits and plain living. The 
whole professional world -lies between 
ese two extremes.

ancient civilization became Pauline 
Christianity; Pauline Christianity be-

the Dark Ages were finally enlightened 
by the Protestant instincts of the Eng- 
lish race. The whole process is summed 
up as Progress with a capital P. And 
any elderly gentleman of Progressive 
temperament will testify that the 1m- 
provement since he was a boy is enor- 
mous.

The point to seize is that social progress 
takes effect through the replacement of 
old institutions by new ones; and since 
every institution involves the recognition 
of the duty of conforming to it, progress 
must involve the repudiation of an es- 
tablished duty at every step. If the 
Englishman had not repudiated the duty 
of absolute obedience to his king, his 
political progress would have been im- 
possible. If women had not repudiated 
the duty of absolute submission to their 
husbands, and defied public opinion as 


297 


to the limits set by modesty to their edu- 
cation, they would never have gained the 
protection of the Married Women’s 
Property Act or the power to qualify 
themselves as medical practitioners. If 
Luther had not trampled on his duty to 
the head of his Church and on his vow 
of chastity, our priests would still have 
to choose between celibacy and _ prof- 
ligacy. There is nothing new, then, in 
the defiance of duty by the reformer: 
every step of progress means a duty re- 
pudiated, and a scripture torn up. 
Quintessence of Ibsenism, pp. 7, 8. 


History, as far as we are capable of his- 
tory (which is not saying much as yet), 
shews that all changes from crudity of 
social organization to complexity, and 
from mechanical agencies in government 
to living ones, seem anarchic at first 
sight. No doubt it is natural to a snail 
to think that any evolution which threat- 
ens to do away with shells will result 
in general death from exposure. Never-

theless, the most elaborately housed be- 
ings today are born not only without 
houses on their backs but without even 
fur or feathers to clothe them. 

The Perfect Wagnerite, p. 77. 


Even if man’s increased command over 
Nature included any increased command 
over himself (the only sort of command 
relevant to his evolution into a higher 
being), the fact remains that it is only by 
running away from the increased com- 
mand over Nature to country places 
where Nature 1s still in primitive com- 
mand over Man that he can recover 
from the effects of the smoke, the stench, 
the foul air, the overcrowding, the 
racket, the ugliness, the dirt which our 
civilization costs us. If manufacturing 
activity means Progress, the town must 
be more advanced than the country; and 
the field laborers and village artisans of 
today must be much less changed from 
the servants of Job than the proletariat 
of modern London from the proletariat 


299 


of Cesar’s Rome. Yet the cockney pro- 
letarian is so inferior to the village 
laborer that it is only by steady recruit- 
ing from the country that London is 
kept alive. Three Plays for Puritans,

Unfortunately, human _ enlightenment 
does not progress by nicer and nicer ad- 
justments, but by violent corrective re- 
actions which invariably send us clean 
over our saddle and would bring us to 
the ground on the other side if the next 
reaction did not send us back again with 
equally excessive zeal. Ecclesiasticism 
and Constitutionalism send us one way, 
Protestantism and Anarchism the other; 
Order rescues us from confusion and 
lands us in Tyranny; Liberty then saves 
the situation and is presently found to be 
as great a nuisance as Despotism. A 
scientifically balanced application of these 
forces, theoretically possible, is practi- 
cally incompatible with human passion.

pt 
A STATE which is too humane to 
punish will also be too thrifty to 
waste the life of honest men in watching 
or restraining dishonest ones. ‘That 1s 
why we do not imprison dogs. We even 
take our chance of their first bite. But if 


302 


a dog delights to barkand bite, it goes to 
the lethal chamber. ‘That seems to me 
sensible. To allow the dog to expiate his 
bite by a period of torment, and then 
let him loose in a much more savage con- 
dition (for the chain makes a dog sav- 
age) to bite again and expiate again, 
having meanwhile spent a great deal of 
human life and happiness in the task of 
chaining and feeding and tormenting 
him, seems to me idiotic and supersti- 
tious. Yet that is what we do to men 
who bark and bite and steal. It would 
be far more sensible to put up with their 
vices, as we put with their illnesses, un- 
til they give more trouble than they are 
worth, at which point we should, with 
many apologies and expressions of sym- 
pathy, and some generosity in complying 
with last wishes, place them in the lethal 
chamber and get rid of them. Under no 
circumstances should they be allowed to 
expiate their misdeeds by a manufac- 
tured penalty, to subscribe to a charity, 
or to compensate the victims. If there 


393 


is to be no punishment there can be no 
forgiveness. We shall never have a real 
moral responsibility until everyone knows 
that his deeds are irrevocable, and that 
his life depends on his usefulness. 
Hitherto, alas! humanity has never 
dared face these hard facts. We franti- 
cally scatter conscience money and in- 
vent systems of conscience banking, with 
expiatory penalties, atonements, redemp- 
tions, salvations, hospital subscription 
lists and what not, to enable us to con- 
tract-out of the moral code. Not con- 
tent with the old scapegoat and sacrifi- 
cial lamb, we deify human saviors, and 
pray to miraculous virgin intercessors. 
We attribute mercy to the inexorable; 
soothe our consciences after committing 
murder by throwing ourselves on the 
bosom of divine love; and shrink even 
from our own gallows because we are ‘ 
forced to admit that it, at least, is irre- 
vocable—as if one hour of imprison- 
ment were not as irrevocable as any exe- 
cution! Major Barbara, pp. 198, 199.

Atl human progress involves, as its The Pure 

first condition, the willingness of 
the pioneer to make a fool of himself. 
The sensible man is the man who adapts 
himself to existing conditions. The fool 
is the man who persists in trying to adapt 
the conditions to himself. Both ex- 
tremes have their disadvantages. Too 
much sense 1s apt to end in knavery, and 
too much folly in martyrdom. I cling 
to my waning folly as a corrective to my 
waxing good sense as anxiously as I once 
nursed my good sense to defend myself 
against my folly. A young poet always 
starts with an infinitely wise hero: an old 
one—Richard Wagner, for example— 
ends with a “ pure fool.” Socialism at

[ft is said that ‘‘ some things ”’ are too 

sacred to be represented on the stage. 
The phrase ‘‘some things” is highly 
characteristic: it recalls the intelligent 
member of Parliament who supported 
the attempt to exclude the late Charles 
Bradlaugh from the House of Com- 
mons on the ground that ‘“‘ a man ought 


312 


to believe in something or another.” 
But since it 1s just as well not to be friv- 
olously vague in speaking of sacred 
things, let us replace ‘ some things ”’ by 
the mysteries of religion, which is what 
the objectors would mean if, on this 
subject, they were earnest enough to 
mean anything at all. Pray what are 
the mysteries of religion? Are they 
faith, hope, love, heroism, life, creation; 
or are they pews and pulpits, prayer- 
books and Sunday bonnets, copes and 
stoles and dalmatics? Even that large 
section of the population of these isl- 
ands whose religion is the merest idola- 
try of material symbols will not deny 
that the former are the realities of re- 
ligion. Then I ask the gentlemen who 
think that the pews and prayer-books 
are too sacred to be represented on the 
stage, why it is that they have never 
protested against the fact that all our 
dramas deal with faith, hope, love, and 
the rest of the essentials? . . . The ob-

the British drama is annexing steadily 
the territory on which he feels so un-

obstruct that advance will be inevitably 
ground into the mud. When I want

O tolerated Church nor Salvation 
Army can ever win the entire con-

matter what it believes or disbelieves; 
and as the police and the military are 
the instruments by which the rich rob 
and oppress the poor (on legal and 
moral principles made for the purpose), 
it is not possible to be on the side of the 
poor and of the police at the same time. 
Indeed the religious bodies, as the al- 
moners of the rich, become a sort of 
auxiliary police, taking off the insurrec- 
tionary edge of poverty with coals and 
blankets, bread and treacle, and sooth-

of immense and inexpensive happiness

NAPOLEON gained the command Reat of 
of the French army because he was *°"” 
the ablest general in France. But sup- 
pose every individual in the French 
army had been a Napoleon also! None 
the less a commander-in-chief, with his 
whole hierarchy of subalterns, would 
have had to be appointed—by lot if you 
like—and here, again, from the moment 
the lot was cast, the particular Napo- 
leon who drew the straw for command- 
er-in-chief would have been the great, 
the all-powerful Napoleon, much more 
able than the Napoleons who were cor- 
porals and privates. After a year, the 
difference in ability between the men 
who had been doing nothing but sentry 
duty, under no strain of responsibility, 
and the man who had been commanding 
the army would have been enormous. 
As “the defenders of the system of 
Conservatism ” well know, we have for 
centuries made able men out of ordinary 
ones by allowing them to inherit excep- 
tional power and status; and the success 


317 


of the plan in the phase of social devel- 
opment to which it was proper was due 
to the fact that, provided only the fa- 
vored man were really an ordinary man, 
and not a duffer, the extraordinary 
power conferred on him did effectually 
create extraordinary ability as compared 
with that of an agricultural laborer, for 
example, of equal natural endowments. 
The gentleman, the lord, the king, all 
discharging social functions of which the 
laborer is incapable, are products as 
artificial as queen bees. ‘Their supe- 
riority is produced by giving them a 
superior status, just as the inferiority 
of the laborer is produced by giving him 
an inferior status. But the superior in- 
come which is the appanage of superior 
status is not rent of ability. Itis a pay- 
ment made to a man to exercise normal 
ability in an abnormal situation. Rent 
of ability is what a man gets by exercis- 
ing abnormal ability in a normal situa- 
tion. Socialism and Superior Brains,

ORGIVENESS, absolution, atone- 
ment, are figments: punishment is 
only a pretence of cancelling one crime 
by another; and you can no more have 
forgiveness without vindictiveness than 
you can have a cure without a disease. 
You will never get a high morality from 
people who conceive that their misdeeds 
are revocable and pardonable, or in a 
society where absolution and expiation 
are officially provided for us all.

It is exceedingly dificult to make people 
realize that an evil is an evil. For in- 
stance, we seize a man and deliberately 
do him a malicious injury: say, imprison 
him for years. One would not suppose 
that it needed any exceptional clearness 
of wit to recognize in this an act of dia- 
bolical cruelty. But in England such a 
recognition provokes a stare of surprise, 
followed by an explanation that the out- 
rage is punishment or justice or some- 
thing else that is all right, or perhaps 
by a heated attempt to argue that we 
should all be robbed and murdered in 
our beds if such senseless villainies as 
sentences of imprisonment were not 
committed daily. It is useless to argue 
that even if this were true, which it is 


a 


not, the alternative to adding crimes of 
our own to the crimes from which we 
suffer is not helpless submission. 
Chickenpox is an evil; but if I were to 
declare that we must either submit to it 
or else repress it sternly by seizing 
everyone who suffers from it and pun- 
ishing them by inoculation with small- 
pox, I should be laughed at; for though 
nobody could deny that the result would 
be to prevent chickenpox to some ex- 
tent by making people avoid it much 
more carefully, and to effect a further 
apparent prevention by making them 
conceal it very anxiously, yet people 
would have sense enough to see that the 
deliberate propagation of smallpox was 
a creation of evil, and must therefore 
be ruled out in favor of purely humane 
and hygienic measures. Yet in the pre- 
cisely parallel case of a man breaking 
into my house and stealing my wife’s: 
diamonds I am expected as a matter of 
course to steal ten years of his life, tor-

"TO ask me to be reverent with what- 
ever moving appeals to good taste, 
is like asking me to hang from a tree by 
my tail. In me nature has discarded 
the tail, having higher uses for me than 
hanging on trees upside down. She has 
also discarded the bump of venera- 
tion, having nobler attitudes for me 
than kneeling and grovelling. I have 
achieved at least one of the characteris- 
tics of the Superman: the upright pos- 
ture of the soul; and I am as proud of 
it as the first monkey who achieved the 
upright posture of the body, and so felt 
himself a stage nearer the Supermonkey,

tionary. To a Russian or Anglo-In- 
dian bureaucrat, a general election is as 
much a revolution as a referendum or 
plebiscite in which the people fight in- 
stead of voting. The French Revolu- 
tion overthrew one set of rulers and 
substituted another with different inter- 
ests and different views. That is what 
a general election enables the people to 
do in England every seven years if they 
choose. Revolution is therefore a na- 
tional institution in England; and its 
advocacy by an Englishman needs no 
apology. 

Every man is a revolutionist concerning 
the thing he understands. For example, 
every person who has mastered a pro- 
fession is a sceptic concerning it, and 
consequently a revolutionist. 

Every genuinely religious person is a 
heretic and therefore a revolutionist. 
All who achieve real distinction in life 
begin as revolutionists. “he most dis- 
tinguished persons become more revolu- 
tionary as they grow older, though they 


324 


are commonly supposed to become more 
conservative owing to their loss of faith 
in conventional methods of reform. 
Any person under the age of thirty, 
who, having any knowledge of the ex-

ist, is an inferior.

Here am I, for instance, by class a re- 
spectable man, by common sense a hater 
of waste and disorder, by intellectual

the limit of old maidishness; yet I am, 
and have always been, and shall now al- 
ways be, a revolutionary writer, because 
our laws make law impossible; our lib- 
erties destroy all freedom; our property 
is organized robbery; our morality is

an impudent hypocrisy; our wisdom is. 
administered by inexperienced or malex- 
perienced dupes, our power wielded by; 
cowards and weaklings, and our honor 
false in all its points. JI am an enemy;

less encouraging or helpful to people: 
who are its enemies for bad reasons. 
The existing order may shriek that if!

person may drive it to become still worse: 
by trying to assassinate it. I cannot! 
help that, even if I could see what worse 
it could do than it is already doing.

It has been said that the French Revo- 
lution was the work of Voltaire, Rous- 
seau and the Encyclopedists. It seems 
to me to have been the work of men 
who had observed that virtuous indig- 
nation, caustic criticism, conclusive argu- 
ment and instructive pamphleteering, 
even when done by the most earnest 


326 


and witty literary geniuses, were as use- 
less as praying, things going steadily 
from bad to worse whilst the Social 
Contract and the pamphlets of Voltaire 
were at the height of their vogue. 
Eventually, as we know, perfectly re- 
spectable citizens and earnest philan- 
thropists connived at the September 
massacres because hard experience had 
convinced them that if they contented 
themselves with appeals to humanity 
and patriotism, the aristocracy, thougn 
it would read their appeals with the 
greatest enjoyment and appreciation, 
flattering and admiring the writers, 
would none the less continue to conspire 
with foreign monarchists to undo the 
revolution and restore the old system 
with every circumstance of savage ven- 
geance and ruthless repression of pop- 
ular liberties. Major Barbara, pp.

England than the conventional man; 
and I believe that when we begin to 
produce a genuine national drama, this 
apparently anarchic force, the mother 
of higher law and humaner order, will 
underlie it, and that the public will lose 
all patience with the conventional col- 
lapses which serve for last acts to the 
serious dramas of to-day. Depend 
upon it, the miserable doctrine that life 
is a mess, and that there is no way out 
of it, will never nerve any man to write

ROMANCE is always, I think, a romance 
product of ennui, an attempt to es- 
cape from a condition in which real life 
appears empty, prosaic and boresome 
—therefore essentially a gentlemanly 
product. The man who has grappled 
with real life, flesh to flesh and spirit 
to spirit, has little patience with fools’ 
paradises. When Carlyle said to the 
emigrants, ‘‘ Here and now is your 
America,” he spoke as a realist to ro- 
manticists; and Ibsen was of the same 
mind when he finally decided that there 
is more tragedy in the next suburban 
villa than in a whole imaginary Italy of 
unauthentic Borgias. Indeed, in our 
present phase, romance has become the 
literary trade of imaginative weaklings 
who have neither the energy to gain ex- 
perience of life nor the genius to divine 
it. The Saturday Review, 26th June 


897. 

When mankind gets a serious fit, and 

the desire for a true knowledge of the 
333 


world and a noble life in it at all costs 
arises in men and lifts them above lust- 
ing for the trivial luxuries and ideals 
and happy endings of romance, ro- 
mance, repudiated by art and challenged | 
by religion, falls back on its citadel, and 
announces that it has given up all the 
pomps and vanities of this wicked 
world, and recognizes that nothing 1s 
eternally valid and all-redeeming but 
Love. That is to say, the romanticist 
is blind enough to imagine that the 
humanist will accept the abandonment 
of all his minor lies as a bribe for the 
toleration of the most impudent of all 
lies. “I am willing to be redeemed, 
and even religious,” says the converted 
romanticist, “if only the business be 
managed by a pretty woman who will 
be left in my arms when the curtain 
falls.’ The Saturday Review, 23rd 
October 1897. 


For all that, the land of dreams is a 
wonderful place; and the great Roman- 


334 


cers who found the key of its gates were 
no Alnaschars. ‘These artists, inspired 
neither by faith and beatitude, nor by 
strife and realization, were neither 
saints nor crusaders, but pure enchan- 
ters, who conjured up a region where 
existence touches you delicately to the 
very heart, and where mysteriously 
thrilling people, secretly known to you 
in dreams of your childhood, enact a life 
in which terrors are as fascinating as 
delights; so that ghosts and death, agony 
and sin, become, like love and victory, 
phrases of an unaccountable ecstasy. 
Goethe bathed by moonlight in the 
Rhine to learn this white magic, and 
saturated even the criticism and didacti- 
cism of Faust with the strangest charm 
by means of it. Mozart was a most 
wonderful enchanter of this kind: he 
drove very clever men—Oublicheff, for 
example—clean out of their wits by his 
airs from heaven and blasts from hell 
in Le Nozze di Figaro and Don Gio- 
vanni. From the middle of the eigh- 


335 


teenth to the middle of the nineteenth 
century Art went crazy in its search for 
spells and dreams; and many artists 
who, being neither Mozarts nor 
Goethes, had their minds burnt up in- 
stead of cleansed by ‘‘ the sacred fire,” 
yet could make that fire cast shadows 
that gave unreal figures a_ strange 
majesty, and phantom landscapes a 
“light that never was on sea or land.” 
These phrases which I quote were then 
the commonplaces of critics’ rhapsodies. 
Today, alas!—I mean thank good- 
ness !—all this rhapsodizing makes peo- 
ple stare at me as at Rip Van Winkle. 
The lithographs of Delacroix, the 
ghostly tam-tam march in Robert the 
Devil, the tinkle of the goat’s bell in 
Dinorah, the illustrations of Gustave 
Doré, mean nothing to the elect of this 
stern generation but an unintelligible 
refuse of bad drawing; barren, ugly 
orchestral tinkering; senseless and de- 
based ambition. We have been led 
forth from the desert in which these 


336 


mirages were always on the horizon to 
a land overflowing with reality and 
earnestness. But if I were to be stoned 
for it this afternoon by fervent Wag- 
nerites and Ibsenites, I must declare 
that the mirages were once dear and 
beautiful, and that the whole Wagner- 
ian criticism of them, however salutary 
(I have been myself one of its most 
ruthless practitioners), has all along 
been a pious dialectical fraud, because 
it applies the tests of realism and reve- 
lation to the arts of illusion and trans- 
figuration. From the point of view of 
the Building Act the palaces built by 
Mr. Brock, the pyrotechnist, may be 
most pestilent frauds; but that only 
shews that Mr. Brock’s point of view 
is not that of the Building Act, though 
it might be very necessary to deliberate- 
ly force that criticism on his works if 
real architecture shewed signs of being 
seduced by the charms of his coloured 
fires. -It was just such an emergency 
that compeHed Wagner to resort to the 


337 


pious dialectical fraud against his old 
romanticist loves. Their enchantments 
were such that their phantasms, which 
genius alone could sublimate from real 
life, became the models after which the 
Journeyman artist worked and was 
taught to work, blinding him to nature 
and reality, from which alone his tal- 
ent could gain nourishment and origi- 
nality, and setting him to waste his life 
in outlining the shadows of shadows, 
with the result that Romanticism be- 
came, at second hand, the blight and 
dry rot of Art. ‘Then all the earnest 
spirits, from Ruskin and the pre- 
Raphaelites to Wagner and Ibsen, rose 
up and made war onit. Salvator Rosa, 
the romantic painter, went down before 
the preaching of Ruskin as Delacroix 
has gone down before the practice of 
John Maris, Von Uhde, and the im- 
pressionists and realists whose work led 
up to them. Meyerbeer was brutally 
squelched, and Berlioz put out of coun- 
tenance, by the preaching and practice 


338 


of Wagner. And after Ibsen—nay, 
even after the cup-and-saucer realists— 
we no longer care for Schiller; Victor 
Hugo, on his spurious, violently roman- 
tic side, only incommodes us; and the 
spirit of such a wayward masterpiece 
of Romanticism as Alfred de Musset’s 
Lorenzaccio would miss fire with us al- 
together if we could bring ourselves to 
wade through the morass of pseudo- 
medieval Florentine chatter with which 
it begins. Saturday Review, 26th June

It is a cherished tradition in English 

politics that at a meeting of Lord 
Melbourne’s Cabinet in the early days 
of Queen Victoria, the Prime Minister, 
when the meeting threatened to break 
up in confusion, put his back to the door 
and said, in the cynically profane man- 
ner then fashionable: ‘“‘ Gentlemen: we 
can tell the House the truth or we can 
tell it a lie; I do not care a damn which. 
All I insist on is that we shall all tell 
the same lie; and you shall not leave the 
room until you have settled what it is 
to be.”’ Just so does the bourgeois per- 
ceive that the essential thing is not 
whether a convention is right or wrong, 
but that everybody shall know what it 1s 
and observe it. His cry is always: “I 
want to know where I stand.” Tell him 
what he may do and what he may nat 
do; and make him feel that he may de- 
pend on other people doing or not do- 
ing the same; and he feels secure, know- 
ing where he stands and where other 
people stand. His dread and hatred of 


340 


revolutions and heresies and men with 
original ideas is his dread of disorienta- 
tion and insecurity. Three Plays by

Let cruelty or kindness or anything else 
once become customary and it will be 
practised by people to whom it is not at 
all natural, but whose rule of life is stm- 
ply to do only what everybody else does, 
and who would lose their employment 
and starve if they indulged in any pe- 
culiarity. A respectable man will lie 
daily, in speech and in print, about the 
qualities of the article he lives by selling, 
because it is customary to do so. He 
will flog his boy for telling a lie, because 
it is customary to do so. He will also 
flog him for not telling a lie if the boy 
tells inconvenient or disrespectful truths, 
because it is customary to do so. He 
will give the same boy a present on his 
birthday, and buy him a spade and 
bucket at the seaside, because it is cus-

342 


HE real secret of the terror inspired 
by an original thinker is that in re- 
pudiating convention he is repudiating 
that on which his neighbors are relying 
for their sense of security. But he is 
usually also doing something even more 
unpopular. He is proposing new obli- 
gations to add to the already heavy 
burden of duty. When the boy Shelley 
entertained his college friends by elab- 
orately and solemnly cursing his father, 
he only shocked us. But when the man 
Shelley told us that we should feed, 
clothe, and educate all the children in 
the country as carefully as if they were 
our Immediate own, we lost our tempers 
with him, and deprived him of the cus- 
tody of his own children. Three Plays

understand the situation feel their blood 
rising almost to guillotining point.

I HAVE not failed to observe that all 

the drugs, from tea to morphia, and 
all the drams, from lager beer to

less than the best work of which he 1s 
soberly capable. He thinks his work 
better, when he is really only more eas-

eats himself out of health and finally 
out of existence. All other voluptuaries

O one ever feels helpless by the 

side of the self-helper; whilst the 
self-sacrificer is always a drag, a re- 
sponsibility, a reproach, an everlasting

who have helped themselves know how 
to help others, and to respect their right 
to help themselves. Although roman- 
tic idealists generally insist on self-sur- 
render as an indispensable element in 
true womanly love, its repulsive effect is 
well known and feared in practice by 
both sexes. The extreme instance is the 
reckless self-abandonment seen in the in- 
fatuation of passionate sexual desire. 
Every one who becomes the object of 
that infatuation shrinks from it instinc- 


tively. Love loses its charm when it- 


is not free; and whether the compulsion 
is that of custom and law, or of infatu- 
ation, the effect is the same: it becomes 


valueless. [he desire to give inspires 
no affection unless there is also the 


power to withhold; and the successful

tions, and, failing them, go without.

Shakespear Bur I am bound to add that [ pity 
the man who cannot enjoy Shake- 
spear. He has outlasted thousands of 
abler thinkers, and will outlast a thou- 
sand more. His gift of telling a story 
(provided some one else told it to him 
first); his enormous power over lan-| 
guage, as conspicuous in his senseless 
and silly abuse of it as in his miracles 
of expression; his humor; his sense of 
idiosyncratic character; and his prodig- 
ious fund of that vital energy which is, 
it seems, the true differentiating prop- 
erty behind the faculties, good, bad or 
indifferent, of the man of genius, enable 
him to entertain us so effectively that the 
imaginary scenes and people he has 
created become more real to us than 
our actual life—at least, until our 
knowledge and grip of actual life begins 
to deepen and glow beyond the com- 
mon. When I was twenty I knew 
everybody in Shakespear, from Hamlet 
to Abhorson, much more intimately than 
I knew my living contemporaries; and 


348 


to this day, if the name of Pistol or 
Polonius catches my eye in a newspaper, 
I turn to the passage with more curios- 
ity than if the name were that of—but 
perhaps I had better not mention any 
one in particular. The Saturday Re- 
view, 26th September 1896. 


Shakespear’s power lies in his enormous 
command of word-music, which gives 
fascination to his most blackguardly 
repartees and sublimity to his hollowest 
platitudes, besides raising to the highest 
force all his gifts as an observer, an imi- 
tator of personal mannerisms and charac- 
teristics, a humorist and a story-teller. 
Shakespear’s weakness lies in his com- 
plete deficiency in that highest sphere of 
thought, in which poetry embraces re- 
ligion, philosophy, morality, and the 
bearing of these on communities, which 
is sociology. His characters have no 
religion, no politics, no conscience, no 
hope, no convictions of any sort. There 
are, as Ruskin pointed out, no heroes 


349 


in Shakespear. His test of the worth 
of life is the vulgar hedonic test, and 
since life cannot be justified by this or 
any other external test, Shakespear 
comes out of his reflective period a vul- 
gar pessimist, oppressed with a logical 
demonstration that life is not worth liv- 
ing, and only surpassing Thackeray in 
respect of being fertile enough, instead 
of repeating ‘‘ Vanitas vanitatum”’ at 
second-hand, to word the futile doctrine 
differently and better in such passages 
as ‘* Out, out, brief candle.” This does 
not mean that Shakespear lacked the 
enormous fund of joyousness which is 
the secret of genius, but simply that, like 
most middle-class Englishmen bred in 
private houses, he was a very incompe- 
tent thinker, and took it for granted 
that all inquiry into life began and ended 
with the question ‘‘ Does it pay?,” 
Which, as I could have told him, and as 
Mr. Gilbert Chesterton could have told 
him, is not the point. The Daily News, 
27th April 1905. 
350 


WHAT a pity it is that people who Shake- 
love the sound of Shakespear so Music 
seldom go on the stage! ‘The ear is the 
sure clue to him: only a musician can 
understand the play of feeling which is 
the real rarity in his early plays. Ina 
deaf nation these plays would have died 
long ago. The moral attitude in them 
is conventional and second-hand: the 
borrowed ideas, however finely ex- 
pressed, have not the overpowering 
human interest of those original criti- 
cisms of life which supply the rhetorical 
element in his later works. Even the 
individualization which produces that 
old-established British specialty, the 
Shakespearean “ delineation of charac- 
ter,’ owes all its magic to the turn of 
the line, which lets you into the secret 
of its utterer’s mood and temperament, 
not by its commonplace meaning, but by 
some subtle exaltation, or stultification, 
or slyness, or delicacy, or hesitancy, or 
what not in the sound of it. In short, 
it is the score and not the libretto that 


351 


keeps the work alive and fresh; and this 
is why only musical critics should be al- 
lowed to meddle with Shakespear—es- 
pecially early Shakespear. The Satur- 
day Review, 2nd February 1895. 


Why is it that Da Ponte’s “ dramma 
giocosa,”’ entitled Don Giovanni, a loath- 
some story of a coarse, witless, worth- 
less libertine, who kills an old man in a 
duel and 1s finally dragged down through 
a trapdoor to hell by his twaddling 
ghost, is still, after more than a cen- 
tury, as “immortal”? as Much Ado? 
Simply because Mozart clothed it with 
wonderful music, which turned the 
worthless words and thoughts of Da 
Ponte into a magical human drama of 
moods and transitions of feeling. That 
is what happened in a smaller way with 
Much Ado. Shakespear shews himself 
in it a commonplace librettist working 
on a stolen plot, but a great musician. 
No matter how poor, coarse, cheap and 
obvious the thought may be, the mood 


352 


is charming, and the music of the words 
expresses the mood. Paraphrase the en- 
counters of Benedick and Beatrice in the 
style of a blue book, carefully preserving 
every idea they present, and it will be- 
come apparent to the most infatuated 
Shakespearean that they contain at best 
nothing out of the common in thought 
or wit, and at worst a good deal of vul- 
gar naughtiness. Paraphrase Goethe, 
Wagner or Ibsen in the same way, and 
you will find original observation, subtle 
thought, wide comprehension, far-reach- 
ing intuition, and serious psychological 
study in them. Give Shakespear a fairer 
chance in the comparison by paraphras- 
ing even his best and maturest work, and 
you will still get nothing more than the 
platitudes of proverbial philosophy, with 
a very occasional curiosity in the shape 
of a rudiment of some modern idea, not 
followed up. Not until the Shakespear- 
ean music is added by replacing the para- 
phrase with the original lines does the 
enchantment begin. ‘Then you are in 


353 


another world at once. When a flower- 
girl tells a coster to hold his jaw, for 
nobody 1s listening to him, and he re- 
torts, ‘Oh, youre there, are you, you 
beauty ?’’ they reproduce the wit of Bea- 
trice and Benedick exactly. But put it 
this way. ‘J wonder that you will still 
be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody 
marks you.” ‘“‘ What! my dear Lady 
Disdain, are you yet living?”’ You are 
miles away from costerland at once. 
When I tell you that Benedick and the 
coster are equally poor in thought, Bea- 
trice and the flower-girl equally vulgar 
in repartee, you reply that I might as 
well tell you that a nightingale’s love is 
no higher than a cat’s. Which is ex- 
actly what I do tell you, though the 
nightingale is the better musician. You 
will admit, perhaps, that the love of the 
worst human singer in the world is ac- 
companied by a higher degree of intel- 
lectual consciousness than that of the 
most ravishingly melodious nightingale. 
Well, in just the same way, there are 


354 


plenty of quite second-rate writers who 
are abler thinkers and wits than Wil- 
liam, though they are unable to weave 
his magic into the expression of their 
thoughts. 

It is not easy to knock this into the pub- 
lic head, because comparatively few of 
Shakespear’s admirers are at all con- 
scious that they are listening to music as 
they hear his phrases turn and his lines 
fall so fascinatingly and memorably; 
whilst we all, no matter how stupid we 
are, can understand his jokes and plati- 
tudes, and are flattered when we are told 
of the subtlety of the wit we have rel- 
ished, and the profundity of the thought 
we have fathomed. Englishmen are 
specially susceptible to this sort of flat- 
tery, because intellectual subtlety is not 
their strong point. In dealing with them 
you must make them believe that you are 
appealing to their brains when you are 
really appealing to their senses and feel- 
ings. With Frenchmen the case is re- 
versed: you must make them believe that 


355 


Shake- 
spear’s 
Plays 


you are appealing to their senses and 
feelings when you are really appealing 
to their brains. ‘The Englishman, slave 
to every sentimental ideal and dupe of 
every sensuous art, will have it that his 
great national poet is a thinker. ‘The 
Frenchman, enslaved and duped only by 
systems and calculations, insists on his 
hero being a sentimentalist and artist. 
That is why Shakespear is esteemed a 
master-mind in England, and wondered 
at as a clumsy barbarian in France. The

HAMLET 


R. FORBES ROBERTSON is es- 
sentially a classical actor. What 

I mean by classical is that he can present 
a dramatic hero as a man whose passions 
are those which have produced the phi- 
losophy, the poetry, the art, and the 
statecraft of the world, and not merely 
those which have produced its weddings, 
coroner’s inquests, and executions. And 


356 


that is just the sort of actor that Hamlet 
requires. A Hamlet who only under- 
stands his love for Ophelia, his grief 
for his father, his vindictive hatred of 
his uncle, his fear of ghosts, his impulse 
to snub Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, 
and the sportsman’s excitement with 
which he lays the ‘“ mouse-trap”’ for 
Claudius, can, with sufficient force or 
virtuosity of execution, get a great repu- 
tation in the part, even though the very 
intensity of his obsession by these senti- 
ments (which are common not only to 
all men but to many animals), shews 
that the characteristic side of Hamlet, 
the side that differentiates him from 
Fortinbras, is absolutely outside the ac- 
tor’s consciousness. Such a reputation 
is the actor’s, not Hamlet’s. Hamlet is 
not a man in whom “ common human- 
ity.’’ is raised by great vital energy toa 
heroic pitch, like Coriolanus or Othello. 
On the contrary, he is a man in whom 
the common personal passions are so 
superseded by wider and rarer interests, 


357. 


and so discouraged by a degree of criti- 
cal self-consciousness which makes the 


practical efficiency of the instinctive man 


on the lower plane impossible to him, 


that he finds the duties dictated by con- | 


ventional revenge and ambition as dis- 
agreeable a burden as commerce is to 
a poet. Even his instinctive sexual im- 
pulses oftend his intellect; so that when 
he meets the woman who excites them 
he invites her to join him in a bitter and 
scornful criticism of their joint absurdity, 
demanding ‘‘ What should such fellows 
as I do crawling between heaven and 
earth? Why would’st thou be a breeder 
of sinners?’”’ and so forth, all of which 
is so completely beyond the poor girl 
that she naturally thinks him mad. And, 
indeed, there is a sense in which Hamlet 
is insane; for he trips over the mistake 
which lies on the threshold of intellec- 
tual self-consciousness: that of bringing 
life to utilitarian or Hedonistic tests, 
thus treating it as a means instead of an 
end. Because Polonius is ‘a foolish 


358 


prating knave,” because Rosencrantz 


and Guildenstern are snobs, he kills them 
as remorselessly as he. might kill a flea, 
shewing that he has no real belief in the 
superstitious reason which he gives for 
not killing himself, and in fact antici- 
pating exactly the whole course of the in- 
tellectual history of Western Europe un- 
til Schopenhauer found the clue that 
Shakespear missed. But to call Hamlet 
mad because he did not anticipate Scho- 
penhauer is like calling Marcellus mad 
because he did not refer the Ghost to the 
Psychical Society. It is in fact not possi- 
ble for any actor to represent Hamlet 
as mad. He may (and generally does) 
combine some notion of his own of a 
man who is the creature of affectionate 
sentiment with the figure drawn by the 
lines of Shakespear; but the result is not 
a madman, but simply one of those mon- 
sters produced by the imaginary com- 
binations of two normal species, such as 
sphinxes, mermaids, or centaurs. And 
this is the invariable resource of the in- 


359 


stinctive, imaginative, romantic actor 
You will see him weeping bucketsful o- 
tears over Ophelia, and treating thi 
players, the grave-digger, Horatio 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as if they 
were mutes at his own funeral. But ge 
and watch Mr. Forbes Robertson’ 
Hamlet seizing delightedly on every op: 
portunity for a bit of philosophic dis» 
cussion or artistic recreation to escape’ 
from the “ cursed spite ”’ of revenge anc 
love and other common troubles; see: 
how he brightens up when the players 
come; how he tries to talk philosophy 
with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern the 
moment they come into the room; how: 
he stops on his country walk with Hora- 
tio to lean over the churchyard wall and: 
draw out the gravedigger whom he sees 
singing at his trade; how even his fits 
of excitement find expression in declaim- 
ing scraps of poetry; how the shock 
of Ophelia’s death relieves itself in 
the fiercest intellectual contempt for 
Laertes’s ranting, whilst an hour after- 


360 





















ards, when Laertes stabs him, he bears 
no malice for that at all, but embraces 
im gallantly and comradely ; and how 
he dies as we forgive everything to 
Charles II. for dying, and makes “the 
rest is silence’’ a touchingly humorous 
apology for not being able to finish his 
usiness. See all that; and you have seen 
a true classical Hamlet. Nothing half 
o charming has been seen by this gen- 
Be tion. It will bear seeing again and 
again. The Saturday Review, 2nd Oc- 
tober 1897. 
JULIUS CHSAR 

t is when we turn to Julius Cesar, the 
ost splendidly written political melo- 
drama we possess, that we realize the 
apparently immortal author of Hamlet 
as a man, not for all time, but for an 
age only, and that, too, in all solidly wise 
nd heroic aspects, the most despicable 
»f all the ages in our history. It is im- 
oossible for even the most judicially- 
minded critic to look without a revulsion 
of indignant contempt at this travestying 


361 


| 


of a great man as a silly braggart, whilst 
the pitiful gang of mischief-makers who 
destroyed him are lauded as statesmen 
and patriots. There is not a single sen- 
tence uttered by Shakespear’s Julius 
Cesar that is, I will not say worthy of 
him, but even worthy of an average 
Tammany boss. Brutus is nothing but 
a familiar type of English suburban 
preacher: politically he would hardly im- 
press the Thames Conservancy Board. 
Cassius is a vehemently assertive nonen- 
tity. It is only when we come to An- 
tony, unctuous voluptuary and self-seek- 
ing sentimental demagogue, that we find 
Shakespear in his depth; and in his 
depth, of course, he is superlative. Re- 
garded as a crafty stage job, the play is 
a triumph: rhetoric, claptrap, effective 
gushes of emotion, all the devices of 
the popular playwright, are employed 
with a profusion of power that almost 
breaks their backs. No doubt there aré 
slips and slovenlinesses of the kind that 
careful revisers eliminate; but they 


362 


count for so little in the mass of accom- 
plishment that it is safe to say that the 
dramatist’s art can be carried no further 
on that plane. If Goethe, who under- 
stood Cesar and the significance of his 
death—" the most senseless of deeds ”’ 
he called it—had treated the subject, his 
conception of it would have been as su- 
perior to Shakespear’s as St. John’s Gos- 
pel is to the Police News; but his treat- 
ment could not have been more magnif- 
icently successful. As far as sonority, 
imagery, wit, humor, energy of imagina- 
tion, power over language, and a whim- 
sically keen eye for idiosyncrasies can 
make a dramatist, Shakespear was the 
king of dramatists. Unfortunately, a 
man may have them all, and yet conceive 
high affairs of state exactly as Simon 
Tappertit did. In one of the scenes in 
Julius Cesar a conceited poet bursts into 
the tent of Brutus and Cassius, and ex- 
horts them not to quarrel with one an- 
other. If Shakespear had been able to 
present his play to the ghost of the great 


363 


Julius, he would probably have had 
much the same reception. He certainly 
would have deserved it. The Saturday 
Review, 29th January 1898. 


THE TAMING OF THE SHREW 


The Taming of the Shrew is a remark- 
able example of Shakespear’s repeated 
attempts to make the public accept real- 
istic comedy. Petruchio is worth fifty 
Orlandos as a human study. The pre- 
liminary scenes in which he shews his 
character by pricking up his ears at the 
news that there is a fortune to be got 
by any man who will take an ugly and 
ill-tempered woman off her father’s : 
hands, and hurrying off to strike the bar- 
gain before somebody else picks it up, 
are not romantic; but they give an hon- 
est and masterly picture of a real man, 
whose like we have all met. The actual 
taming of the woman by the methods 
used in taming wild beasts belongs to his 
determination to make himself rich and 
comfortable, and his perfect freedom 


364 


from all delicacy in using his strength 
and opportunities for that purpose. 
The process is quite bearable, because 
the selfishness of the man is healthily 
goodhumored and untainted by wanton 
cruelty; and it is good for the shrew to 
encounter a force like that and be 
brought to her senses. Unfortunately, 
Shakespear’s own immaturity, as well 
as the immaturity of the art he was ex- 
perimenting in, made it impossible for 
him to keep the play on the realistic 
plane to the end; and the last scene is 
altogether disgusting to modern sensi- 
bility. No man with any decency of 
feeling can sit it out in the company 
of a woman without being extremely 
ashamed of the lord-of-creation moral 
implied in the wager and the speech put 
into the woman’s own mouth. ‘There- 
fore the play, though still worthy of a 
complete and efficient representation, 
would need, even at that, some apology.

The 
Shirtfront 


New that we are nearly done with 

the nineteenth century, it can hurt 
no one’s feelings to remark that it has 
been one in which the leading faculty has 
been the business faculty, and the lead- 
ing ambition the attainment of unprece- 
dented riches. Functional adaptation 
has worked towards capitalism rather 
than towards art or religion. We have 
kept up an air of supporting the arts by 
substituting respectability for the beauty 
of life, regularity of arrangement for 
the beauty of form, laundry work for 
beauty of color, historical interest for 
beauty of theme, and so on. If you 
take a man in whom this substitution 
has been completely effected by delib- 
erate precept and social environment 
(as far as such dehumanization is pos- 
sible), and present to him a fabric 
which drapes in graceful folds and 
is beautiful in color, he will imme- 
diately pronounce it eminently unsuit- 
able for use as a dress material. The 
folds are irregular, and therefore dis- 


366 


reputable; the color is sensuous, and 
therefore immoral; the general effect 
appeals to the individual, idiosyncratic 
preference, and is, therefore, eccentric 
and in bad taste. Only, if the color be 
a very bright primary one—say bright 
scarlet or yellow—which will shew the 
least speck of dust or weatherstain, and 
will not, like the tertiary colors, soften 
and actually take on a new beauty as it 
wears, he will admit its suitability for 
uniforms to be worn on State occasions. 
But for everyday wear absolute perfec- 
tion means to him shiny black and shiny 
white—the absence of color with the 
maximum of surface polish, the mini- 
mum of drapery, and the most conclu- 
sive evidence of newness and washed: 
ness. At first his great difficulty 
was with his shirt, because folds 
and even outrageous crumplings were 
unavoidable if it was to be worn 
at all. But, at all events, a part of the 
shirt could be stiff, like a cuirass. So 
he took a piece of linen large enough to 


367 


cover his chest, and at first, not realizing 
that it only needed originality and cour- 
age to immediately attain his ideal of 
no folds at all, arranged the folds in 
perfectly rectangular parallel rows, by 
means of his great invention of box- 
pleating. Down the middle, as a last 
concession to the traditions of the 
chemise, he affixed a frill, like a row of 
textile parsley. Thus he produced the 
British Islander’s shirtfront. In his de- 
light with it, he attached sleeves and 
a body; starched it within an inch of its 
life; put it on, with a complete clergy- 
man’s suit over it; and, restless with joy, 
walked about, sat down, got up, and 
even stooped. On removing the suit, he 
of course discovered that the shirt was 
all crumpled except the front. He there- 
fore cut a large window out of his waist- 
coat, through which the uncrumpled part 
of his masterpiece could be viewed, and 
cut the coat away so as not to obstruct 
the window. And then he was in even- 
ing dress. Later on he discarded the 


368 


row of parsley; the box-pleats went next; 
the button-holes were reduced from three 
to one by the more logical spirits; varie- 
gated studs gave way to the colourless 
diamond or even the vapid mother-of- 
pearl; and finally the shirt was buttoned 
behind, leaving the front so unbrokenly 
perfect that poets and artists could not 
behold it without longing to write a son- 
net or draw a caricature on it. The Sat- 
urday Review, 15th February 1896.

G OCIAL questions are produced by 
the conflict of human institutions 
with human feeling. For instance, we 
have certain institutions regulating the 
lives of women. To the woman whose 
feelings are entirely in harmony with 
these institutions there is no Woman 
Question. But during the present cen- 
tury, from the time of Mary Wolle- 
stonecraft onwards, women have been

disgusting homeliness, used to tell me 
never to throw away dirty water until 
I got in clean. To which I would re-

A man there was, tho’ some did count 
him mad, 
The more he cast away, the more he 


had. 


Indeed, in the matter of ideals, faiths,

that Nature abhorred a vacuum, and 
that you might empty your bucket boldly 
with the fullest assurance that you would 
find it fuller than ever before you had 
time to set it down again. But herein 
I youthfully deceived myself. I grew 
up to find the genteel world full of per-

tion of villains and heroes. Shake-

ture inverted, so that not only are love, 
pity, and honor loathsome to him, and 
the affectation of them which society im- 
poses on him a constant source of dis- 
gust, but cruelty, destruction, and per- 
fidy are his most luxurious passions. 
This is a totally different phenomenon 
from the survivals of the ape and tiger 
in a normal man. The average normal 
man is covetous, lazy, selfish; but he is 
not malevolent, nor capable of saying 
to himself, “‘ Evil: be thou my good.” 
He only does wrong as a means to an 
end, which he always represents to him- 
self as a right end. The case is exactly 
reversed with a villain; and it is my 
melancholy duty to add that we some- 
times find it hard to avoid a cynical sus- 
picion that the balance of social advan- 
tage is on the side of gifted villainy, 
since we see the able villain, Mephis- 
topheles-like, doing a huge amount of 
good in order to win the power to do a 
little darling evil, out of which he is as 
likely as not to be cheated in the end; 


374 


whilst your normal respectable man will 
countenance, connive at, and grovel his 
way through all sorts of meanness, base- 
ness, servility, and cruel indifference to 
suffering in order to enjoy a miserable 
two-penn’orth of social position, piety, 
comfort, and domestic affection, of 
which he, too, is often ironically de- 
frauded by Fate. I could point to a 
philanthropist or two—even to their sta- 
tues—whom Posterity, should it ever 
turn from admiring the way they spent 
their money to considering the way they 
got it, will probably compare very un- 
favorably with Guy Fawkes. The Sat-

Now that we have reached the 

stage of international organization, 
Man’s political capacity and magnanim- 
ity are clearly beaten by the vastness 
and complexity of the problems forced 
on him. And it is at this anx- 
ious moment that he finds, when he 
looks upward for a mightier mind to 
help him, that the heavens are empty. 
He will presently see that his discarded 
formula that Man is the Temple of the 
Holy Ghost, happens to be precisely 
true, and that it is only through his own 
brain and hand that this Holy Ghost, 
formerly the most nebulous person 
in the Trinity, and now become its 
sole survivor as it has always been its real 
Unity, can help him in any way. Andso, 
if the Superman is to come, he must be 
born of Woman by Man’s intentional

and well-considered contrivance. Con- 
viction of this will smash everything that 
opposes it. Even Property and Mar- 
riage, which laugh at the laborer’s petty 
complaint that he is defrauded of “ sur- 
plus value,” and at the domestic miseries 
of the slaves of the wedding ring, will 
themselves be laughed aside as the light- 
est of trifles if they cross this conception 
when it becomes a fully realized vital 
purpose of the race.

The really interesting question is whether 
I am right in assuming that the way to 
produce an impression of greatness is by 
exhibiting a man, not as mortifying his 
nature by doing his duty, in the manner 
which our system of putting little men 
into great positions (not having enough 
great men in our influential families to 
go round) forces us to inculcate, but as 
simply doing what he naturally wants to 
do. Three Plays for Puritans, p. 207.

If there were no God, said the eighteenth 
century Deist, it would be necessary to 
invent Him. Now this eighteenth cen- 
tury god was deus ex machina, the god 
who helped those who could not help 
themselves, the god of the lazy and in- 
capable. The nineteenth century decided 
that there is indeed no such god; and now 
Man must take in hand all the work that 
he used to shirk with an idle prayer. He 
must, in effect, change himself into the 
political Providence which he formerly 
conceived as God; and such change is not 
only possible, but the only sort of change 
that is real. ‘he mere transfiguration of 
institutions, as from military and priestly 
dominance to commercial and scientific 
dominance, from commercial dominance 
to proletarian democracy, from slavery 
to serfdom, from serfdom to capitalism, 
from monarchy to republicanism, from 
polytheism to monotheism, from mono- 
theism to atheism, from atheism to pan- 
theistic humanitarianism, from general il- 
literacy to general literacy, from romance 


379 


to realism, from realism to mysticism, 
from metaphysics to physics, are all but 
changes from weedledum to Tweedle- 
dee; plus ca change, plus c’est la méme 
chose. But the changes from the crab 
apple to the pippin, from the wolf and 
fox to the house dog, from the charger 
of Henry V. to the brewer's draught 
horse and the race horse, are real; for 
here Man has played the god, subdu- 
ing Nature to his intention, and en- 
nobling or debasing Life for a set pur- 
pose. And what can be done with a 
wolf can be done with a man. If such 
monsters as the tramp and the gentle- 
man can appear as mere by-products of 
Man’s individual greed and folly, what 
might we not hope for as a main prod- 
uct of his universal aspiration?

are; and poets who plan Utopias and 
prove that nothing is necessary for their 
realization but that Man should will

that Man does not effectively will them.

discovered means. Of all other sorts

I know no harder practical question than 
how much selfishness one ought to stand 
from a gifted person for the sake of his 
gifts or on the chance of his being right: 
in the long run. ‘The Superman will 
certainly come like a thief in the night, 
and be shot at accordingly; but we can- 
not leave our property wholly unde-- 
fended on that account. On the other 
hand, we cannot ask the Superman sim- 
ply to add a higher set of virtues'to cur- 
rent respectable morals; for he is un- 
doubtedly going to empty a good deal 
of respectable morality out like so much 
dirty water, and replace it by new and 
strange customs, shedding old obliga- 
tions and accepting new and heavier 
ones. Every step of his progress must 
horrify conventional people; and if it 
were possible for even the most superior 
man to march ahead all the time, every 
pioneer of the march towards the Super- 
man would be crucified.

OUR shops and business offices are 
full of young men living in lonely 
lodgings, whose only artistic recreation 
is the theatre. In the theatre we prac- 
tise upon them every art that can make 
their loneliness intolerable and heighten 
the charm of the bait in the snares of 
the street as they go home. But when 
a dramatist is enlightened enough to un- 
derstand the danger, and sympathetic 
enough to come to the rescue with a 
play to expose the snare and warn the 
victim, we forbid the manager to per- 
form it on pain of ruin, and denounce 
the author as a corrupter of morals. 
One hardly knows whether to laugh or 
cry at such perverse stupidity.

Toleration 


cause the word toleration has been mor- 
alized by eminent Whigs; but what he 
means by toleration is toleration of 
doctrines that he considers enlightened, 
and, by liberty, liberty to do what he 
considers right: that is, he does not 
mean toleration or liberty at all; for 
there is no need to tolerate what ap- 
pears enlightened or to claim liberty 
to do what most people consider 
right. Toleration and liberty have no 
sense or use except as toleration of opin- 
ions that are considered damnable, and 
liberty to do what seems wrong. Set- 
ting Englishmen free to marry their de- 
ceased wife’s sisters is not tolerated by 
the people who approve of it, but by 
the people who regard it as incestuous. 
Catholic Emancipation and the admis- 
sion of Jews to parliament needed no 
toleration from Catholics and Jews: the 
toleration they needed was that of the 
people who regarded the one measure 
as a facilitation of idolatry, and the 
other as a condonation of the crucifix- 


386 


ion. Clearly such toleration is not 
clamored for by the multitude or by the 
press which reflects its prejudices. It is 
essentially one of those abnegations of 
passion and prejudice which the com- 
mon man submits to because uncommon 
men whom he respects as wiser than 
himself assure him that it must be so, 
or the higher affairs of human destiny 
will suffer. The Shewing-up of Blanco

WE have among us a certain num- A Vigilance 
ber of people who are morbidly “°%##" 
ensitive to sexual impressions, and 
juite insensible to artistic ones. We 
1ave certain sects in which such a con- 
lition is artificially induced as a matter 
f religious duty. Children have their _ 
ffections repressed, and their suscepti- 
ulity to emotional excitement nursed on 
in, wrath, terror, and vengeance, whilst 
hey are forbidden to go to the theatre 
xr to amuse themselves with stories or 
‘profane’ pictures. Naturally, when 
such people grow up, life becomes to 
them a prolonged temptation of St. An- 
hony. You try to please them by a 
sicture which appeals to their delight in 
sraceful form and bright warm colour, 
to their share in the romance which peo- 
ples the woods and streams with sylphs 
and water maidens, to the innocent and 
highly recreative love of personal 
beauty, which is one of the great ad- 
vantages of having a sex at all. To 
your horror and discomposure, you are 


389

met by a shriek of ‘‘ Nude woman: nude’ 
woman: police!’ The one thing that! 
the normal spectator overlooks in the 
picture is the one thing that St. An» 
thony sees in it. Let me again put his: 
protest in Mr ’s own words: 
‘’ Nothing can justify the exhibition of! 
nude and semi-nude women as a means: 
of amusement for a mixed audience, 
They are shameful productions, and de 
serve the condemnation of all right 
thinking people. The manager de 
serves, and should have, the immediate 
attention of the County Council.” 

You remonstrate, perhaps, from the 
point of view of the artist. Mr 
at once pleads: ‘‘ They are so very ob- 
viously living. Human nature is so very 
much in evidence.”’ And there you 
have the whole of Mr. ’s pessiss 
tic, misanthropic philosophy in two sen-| 

tences. Human nature and the human 
body are to him nasty things. Sex is) 
a scourge. Woman is a walking temp-) 
tation which should be covered up as} 


390 











much as possible. Well, let us be 
charitable to Mr ’s infirmity, and 
ask him, as kindly as may be, what good 
covering women up will do. Carmen- 
cita is covered up: our skirt dancers are 
all petticoats; each of our serpentine 
dancers carries drapery enough to make 
skirts for a whole dozen schoolgirls. 
And yet they appeal far more to the sex 
instinct and far less to the artistic in- 
stinct than the Natads and Phryne. 
There is only one solution of the difh- 
culty ; and that is for Mr and 
those who sympathize with him to keep 
away from the Theatre. Of 
course that will not protect them alto- 
gether. Every low-necked dress, every 
gust of wind that catches a skirt and 
reveals an ankle, perhaps every child 
in whom “ human nature ts in evidence ” 
to the extent of a pair of sturdy little 
legs, may be a torment to the victims 
of this most pitiable of all obsessions. 
quarrel with human nature admits 
f no fundamental remedy except the 


Sas 



























knife; and I should be sorry to see the 
members of the Vigilance Association 
cutting their own throats: they are use- 
ful and even necessary in keeping order 
among the people who suffer from mor- 
bid attractions instead of morbid re 
pulsions. For it must not be forgotten 
that Mr ’s error does not lie in his 
claim that the community shall suppress 
indecent exhibitions, but in his attempt 
to make nudity or semi-nudity the cri 
terion of indecency. Perhaps I should 
qualify this statement of his position by 
limiting nudity to the female sex; for I 
notice that the semi-nudity which is quite 
a common spectacle in the case of male 
athletes is not complained of, though, 
if there were anything in the Vigilance 
Association’s view of such exhibitions as 
demoralizing, our women ought by this 
time to be much more demoralized than 
our men. The Saturday Review, 6th

strive to root out of themselves as they 
strive to root out the tiger’s lust for 
blood. On the contrary, the curiosity 
of the ape, or of the child who pulls 
out the legs and wings of a fly to see 
what it will do without them, or who, on 
being told that a cat dropped out of 
the window will always fall on its legs, 
immediately tries the experiment on the 
nearest cat from the highest window 
in the house (I protest I did it myself 
from the first floor only), is as nothing 
compared to the thirst for knowledge 
of the philosopher, the poet, the biolo- 
gist, and the naturalist... . When 
Gray said ‘“‘ Where ignorance is bliss, 
tis folly to be wise,” he forgot that it 
is godlike to be wise; and since nobody 
wants bliss particularly, or could stand 
more than a very brief taste of it if it 
were attainable, and since everybody, 
by the deepest law of the Life Force, de- 
sires to be godlike, it is stupid, and in- 
deed blasphemous and despairing, to 
hope that the thirst for knowledge will 


394 


either diminish or consent to be subor- 
dinated to any other end whatsoever. 
We shall see later on that the claim 
that has arisen in this way for the 
unconditioned pursuit of knowledge is 
as idle as all dreams of unconditioned 
activity; but none the less the right 
to knowledge must be regarded as 
a fundamental human right. The 
fact that men of science have had to 
fight so hard to secure its recognition, 
and are still so vigorously persecuted 
when they discover anything that ts not 
quite palatable to vulgar people, makes 
them sorely jealous for that right; and 
when they hear a popular outcry for the 
suppression of a method of research 
which has an air of being scientific, their 
first instinct is to rally to the defence 
of that method without further consid- 
eration, with the result that they some- 
times, as in the case of vivisection, pres- 
ently find themselves fighting on a false 
issue. The Doctor's Dilemma, pp. 
XXXIx., xl. 


395 


The real remedy for vivisection is the 
remedy for all the mischief that the- 
medical profession and all the other 
professions are doing: namely, more 
knowledge. ‘The juries which send the 
poor Peculiars to prison, and give vivi- 
sectionists heavy damages against hu- 
mane persons who accuse them of 
cruelty; the editors and councillors and 
student-led mobs who are striving to 
make Vivisection one of the watch- 
words of our civilization, are not doc-™ 
tors: they are the British public, all so 
afraid to die that they will cling franti- 
cally to any idol which promises to cure 
all their diseases, and crucify anyone 
who tells them that they must not only 
die when their time comes, but die like 
gentlemen. In their paroxysms of cow- 
ardice and selfishness they force the doc- 
tors to humor their folly and ignorance. 
The Doctor's Dilemma, p. \x. 


The right to knowledge is not the only 
right ; and its exercise must be limited by 


396 


respect for other rights, and for its own 
exercise by others. When a man says 
to Society, “‘ May I torture my mother 
in pursuit of knowledge?”’ Society re- 
plies, “No.” If he pleads, ‘‘ What! 
Not even if I have a chance of finding 
out how to cure cancer by doing it?” 
Society still says, ‘‘ Not even then.” If 
the scientist, making the best of his dis- 
appointment, goes on to ask may he 
torture a dog, the stupid and callous 
people who do not realize that a dog 
is a fellow-creature, and sometimes a 
good friend, may say Yes; though 
Shakespear, Dr. Johnson, and their like 
may say No. But even those who say 
‘You may torture a dog” never say 
“You may torture my dog.’ And no- 
body says, “* Yes, because in the pursuit 
of knowledge you may do as you 
please.” Just as even the stupidest peo- 
ple say, in effect, ‘‘ If you cannot attain 
to knowledge without burning your 
mother, you must do without knowl- 
edge,’’ so the wisest people say, “‘ If you 


397 


cannot attain to knowledge without tor- 
turing a dog, you must do without 
knowledge.’ The Doctor's Dilemma, ~

HE DEVIL. In the old chronicles 

you read of earthquakes and pes- 
tilences, and are told that these shewed 
the power and majesty of God and 
the littleness of Man. Nowadays the 
chronicles describe battles. In a battle 
two bodies of men shoot at one another 
with bullets and explosive shells until 
one body runs away, when the others 
chase the fugitives on horseback and cut 
them to pieces as they fly. And this, 
the chronicle concludes, shews the great- 
ness and majesty of empires, and the 
littleness of the vanquished. Over such 
battles the people run about the streets 
yelling with delight, and egg their Gov- 
ernment on to spend hundreds of mil- 
lions of money in the slaughter, whilst 
the strongest Ministers dare not spend 
an extra penny in the pound against the

they themselves daily walk.

HIHERTO the economists had al- 

ways treated wealth as though it 
could be measured by exchange value. 
Ruskin exposed this as a fundamental 
error: a profound religious, social and 
philosophical error: in short a damnable 
heresy. He asked whether Tintoretto’s 
irremovable, unexchangeable, and con- 
sequently commercially worthless ceiling 
in the School of St. Roch, in Venice, 
was of less value than an obscene French 
lithograph exchangeable for two francs 


400 


fifty in the Rue de Rivoli, and produced 
expressly for sale to English tourists. 
This is but one illustration of Ruskin’s 
method of argument. By it he suc- 
ceeded in making an end of the folly of 
measuring social need by commercial 
demand, or wealth by exchange value. 
And he introduced the conception of 
‘illth ’? as a positive thing to be meas- 
ured and dealt with as urgently as 
“ wellth.” 

Ruskin’s advance was reduced to 
pure economics by Stanley Jevons, who 
treated Ruskin’s wealth and illth as util- 
ity and disutility; raised anew the whole 
question of value; made an end of the 
theory that value is the result of labor 
instead of being the cause of it; abol- 
ished the old distinction between. use 
value and exchange value; and formu- 
lated a law founded on the comparison 
of abstract desirabilities, which gave 
new life to academic economics by 
bringing it into direct relation with hu- 
man passion. Life, Literature and Po-

(THERE are two things that must be 
set right, or we shall perish, like 
Rome, of soul atrophy disguised as em- 
pire. 
The first is, that the daily ceremony of 
dividing the wealth of the country 
among its inhabitants shall be so con- 
ducted that no crumb shall go to any 
able-bodied adults who are not produc- 
ing by their personal exertions not only 
a full equivalent for what they take, but 
a surplus sufficient to provide for their 
superannuation and pay back the debt 
due for their nurture. 
The second is that the deliberate inflic- 
tion of malicious injuries which now 
goes on under the name of punishment 
be abandoned. Major Barbara, p. 198.

which make the patriotic hero famous.

HERE is no harder scientific fact in 
the world than the fact that belief 

can be produced in practically unlimited 
quantity and intensity, without observa- 
tion or reasoning, and even in defiance 
of both, by the simple desire to believe 
founded on a strong interest in believ- 
ing. Everybody recognizes this in the 
case of the amatory infatuations of the 
adolescents who see angels and heroes 
in obviously (to others) commonplace 
and even objectionable maidens and 
youths. But it holds good over the en-

WE can now, aS soon as we are 

strong-minded enough, drop the 
Nirvana nonsense, the pessimism, the 
rationalism, the supernatural theology, 
and all the other subterfuges to which 
we cling because we are afraid to look 
life straight in the face and see in it, not 
the fulfilment of a moral law or of the 
deductions of reason, but the satisfac- 


404 


tion of a passion in us of which we can 
give no rational account whatever. 

It is natural for a man to shrink from 
the terrible responsibility thrown on 
him by this inexorable fact. All his 
stock excuses vanish before if: hve 


woman tempted me,” ‘“ The serpent 
tempted me,” “I was not myself at the 
time,” “‘I meant well,’ ‘’ My passion 


got the better of my reason,” “ It was 
my duty to do it,” “* The Bible says that 
we should do it,”’ “‘ Everybody does it,”’ 
and so on. Nothing is left but the 
frank avowal: A did it because I am 
built that way.’ Every man hates to 
say that. He wants to believe that his 
generous actions are characteristic of 
him, and that his meannesses are aber- 
rations or concessions to the force of 
circumstances. The Sanity of Art, pp.

good angel cannot seize and drag him

[IF we have come to think that the nur- 

sery and the kitchen are the natural 
sphere of a woman, we have done so 
exactly as English children come to 
think that a cage is the natural sphere 


406 


of a parrot—because they have never 
seen one anywhere else. No doubt 
there are Philistine parrots who agree 
with their owners that it 1s better to be 
in a cage than out, so long as there is 
plenty of hempseed and Indian corn 
there. There may even be idealist par- 
rots who persuade themselves that the 
mission of a parrot is to minister to the 
happiness of a private family by whis- 
tling and saying “ Pretty Polly,” and 
that it is in the sacrifice of its liberty 
to this altruistic pursuit that a true par- 
rot finds the supreme satisfaction of its 
soul. I will not go so far as to afirm 
that there are theological parrots who 
are convinced that imprisonment is the 
will of God because it is unpleasant; 
but I am confident that there are ration- 
alist parrots who can demonstrate that 
it would be a cruel kindness to let a 
parrot out to fall a prey to cats, or at 
least to forget its accomplishments and 
coarsen its naturally delicate fibres in 
an unprotected struggle for existence. 


407 


Still, the only parrot a free-souled per- 
son can sympathize with is the one that 
insists on being let out as the first con- 
dition of its making itself agreeable. A 
selfish bird, you may say: one which 
puts its own gratification before that of) 
the family which is so fond of it—be- 
fore even the greatest happiness of the 
greatest number: one that, in aping the 
independent spirit of a man, has unpar- 
roted itself and become a creature that 
has neither the home-loving nature of a 
bird nor the strength and enterprise of 
a mastiff. All the same, you respect 
that parrot in spite of your conclusive 
reasoning; andvif it persists, you will 
have either to let it out or kill it. 
Quintessence of Ibsenism, pp. 43, 44. 


The busybody finds that people cannot 
be freed from their failings from with- 
out. They must free themselves. 
When Nora is strong enough to live out 
of the doll’s house, she will go out of 
it of her own accord if the door stands 


408 


open; but if before that period you 
take her by the scruff of the neck and 
thrust her out, she will only take refuge 
in the next establishment of the kind 
that offers to receive her. Woman has 
thus two enemies to deal with: the old- 
fashioned one who wants to keep the 
door locked, and the new-fashioned one 
who wants to thrust her into the street 
before she is ready to go. 

Quintessence of Ibsenism, p. 104. 


It is false to say that Woman is now 
directly the slave of Man: she is the 
immediate slave of duty; and as man’s 
path to freedom is strewn with the 
wreckage of the duties and ideals he 
has trampled on, so must hers be. She 
may indeed mask her iconoclasm by 
proving in rationalist fashion, as man 
has often done for the sake of a quiet 
life, that all these discarded idealist con- 
ceptions will be fortified instead of shat- 
tered by her emancipation. To a per- 
son with a turn for logic, such proofs 


409 


are as easy as playing the piano is to 
Paderewski. But it will not be true. 
A whole basketful of ideals of the most 
sacred quality will be smashed by the 
achievement of equality for women and 
men. Those who shrink from such a 
clatter and breakage may comfort them-’ 
selves with the reflection that the re- 
placement of the broken goods will be 
prompt and certain. It is always a case 
of “The ideal is dead: long live the 
ideal!’ And the advantage of the 
work of destruction is, that every new 
ideal is less of an illusion than the one 
it has supplanted; so that the destroyer 
of ideals, though denounced as an 
enemy of society, is in fact sweeping the 
world clear of lies. Quintessence of 
[bsenism, p. 45. 


Now of all the idealist abominations 
that make society pestiferous, I doubt if 
there be any so mean as that of forcing 
self-sacrifice on a woman under pretence 
that she likes it; and, if she ventures to 


410 


contradict the pretence, declaring her 
notrue woman. Quintessence of [bsen- 
ism, P. 33. 
The fundamental reason for not allow- 
ing women to risk their lives in battle 
and for giving them the first chance of 
escape in all dangerous emergencies: in 
short, for treating their lives as more 
valuable than male lives, is not in the 
least a chivalrous reason, though men 
may consent to it under the illusion of 
chivalry. It is a simple matter of ne- 
cessity; for if a large proportion of 
women were killed or disabled, no pos- 
sible readjustment of our marriage law 
could avert the depopulation and con- 
sequent political ruin of the country. 
Getting Married, p. 149. 


A slave state is always ruled by those 
who can get round the masters: that ts, 
by the more cunning of the slaves 
themselves. Thus fashionable London, 
like its outposts on the Coast and the 
Riviera, is bound, body and soul, under 


All 


an organized tyranny of servants and 
tradesmen which no _ spirited coolie 
would endure without rebellion. ‘That 
is why Liberal Dukes and Radical Earls 
excite no surprise, whereas a Radical 
valet or a Liberal west-end jeweller has 
never yet been heard of. 
The slavery of women means the 
tyranny of women. No fascinating 
woman ever wants to emancipate her 
sex: her object is to gather power into 
the hands of Man, because she knows 
that she can govern him. She is no 
more Jealous of his nominal supremacy 
than he himself is jealous of the strength 
and speed of his horse. 
Correspondence. 


The cunning and attractive “slave 
women” disguise their strength as 
womanly timidity, their unscrupulous- 
ness as womanly innocence, their impuni- 
ties as womanly defencelessness: simple 
men are duped by them, and little ones 
disarmed and intimidated. They can 


412 


be beaten only by brutal selfishness or 
by their own weapons, which many men 
learn to use with more than feminine 
skill. Correspondence. 


It is only the proud, straightforward 
women who wish, not to govern, but to 
be free, who object to slavery and give 
a hand to the unattractive, drudging 
women, who cannot get round anybody.

lusions of sex, to be preferred in serious 
moments to the silent sympathy of an

Review, 13th March 1897. 


fof 


AMONG the friends to whom I have 

read this play [Man and Super- 
man| in manuscript are some of my 
own sex who are shocked at the “ un- 
scrupulousness,’’ meaning the total dis- 
regard of masculine fastidiousness, with 
which the woman pursues her purpose. 
It does not occur to them that if women 
were as fastidious as men, morally or 
physically, there would be an end of the 
race. Is there anything meaner than 
to throw necessary work upon other peo- 
ple and then disparage it as unworthy 


414 


and indelicate? We laugh at the 
haughty American nation because it 
makes the negro clean its boots and 
then proves the moral and physical in- 
feriority of the negro by the fact that 
he is a shoeblack; but we ourselves 
throw the whole drudgery of creation 
on one sex, and then imply that no fe- 
male of any womanliness or delicacy 
would initiate any effort in that direc- 
tion. There are no limits to male 
hypocrisy in this matter. No doubt 
there are moments when man’s sexual 
immunities are made acutely humiliating 
to him. When the terrible moment of 
birth arrives, its supreme importance 
and its superhuman effort and peril, in 
which the father has no part, dwarf 
him into the meanest insignificance: he 
slinks out of the way of the humblest 
petticoat, happy if he be poor enough to 
be pushed out of the house to outface 
his ignominy by drunken rejoicings. 
But when the crisis is over he takes 
his revenge, swaggering as the bread- 


415 


winner, and speaking of Woman’s 
“sphere”? with condescension, even 
with chivalry, as if the kitchen and the 
nursery were less important than the 
ofice in the city. When his swagger is 
exhausted he drivels into erotic poetry 
Or sentimental uxoriousness; and the 
Tennysonian King Arthur posing at 
Guinevere becomes Don Quixote grovel- 
ling before Dulcinea. You must ad- 
mit that here Nature beats Comedy out 
of the field: the wildest hominist or fem- 
inist farce is insipid after the most com- 
monplace “ slice of life.” The pretence 
that women do not take the initiative 
is part of the farce. Why, the whole 
world is strewn with snares, traps, gins 
and pitfalls for the capture of men by 
women. Give women the vote, and in 
five years there will be a crushing tax 
on bachelors. Men, on the other hand, 
attach penalties to marriage, depriving 
women of property, of the franchise, 
of the free use of their limbs, of that 
ancient symbol of immortality, the right 


416 


to make oneself at home in the house 
of God by taking off the hat, of every- 
thing that he can force Woman to dis- 
pense with without compelling himself 
to dispense with her. All in vain. 
Woman must marry because the race 
must perish without her travail: if the 
risk of death and the certainty of pain, 
danger and unutterable discomforts 
cannot deter her, slavery and swaddled 
ankles will not. And yet we assume 
that the force that carries women 
through all these perils and hardships, 
stops abashed before the primnesses of 
our behavior for young ladies. It is 
assumed that the woman must wait, mo- 
tionless, until she is wooed. Nay, she 
often does wait motionless. ‘That 1s 
how the spider waits for the fly. But 
the spider spins her web. And if the 
fly, like my hero, shews a strength that 
promises to extricate him, how swiftly 
does she abandon her pretence of pas- 
siveness, and openly fling coil after coil 
about him until he is secured for ever! 


417 


If the really impressive books and 
other art-works of the world were pro- 
duced by ordinary men, they would ex- 
press more fear of women’s pursuit than 
love of their illusory beauty. But or- 
dinary men cannot produce really im- 
pressive art-works. Those who can 
are men of genius: that is, men selected 
by Nature to carry on the work of build- 
ing up an intellectual consciousness of 
her own instinctive purpose. Accord- 
ingly, we observe in the man of genius 
all the unscrupulousness and all the 
‘ self-sacrifice’ (the two things are the 
same) of Woman. He will risk the 
stake and the cross; starve, when neces- 
sary, in a garret all his life; study wom- 
en and live on their work and care as 
Darwin studied worms and lived upon 
sheep; work his nerves into rags with- 
out payment, a sublime altruist in his 
disregard of himself, an atrocious ego- 
tist in his disregard of others. Here 
Woman meets a purpose as impersonal, 
as irresistible as her own; and the clash 


418 


is sometimes tragic. When it is com- 
plicated by the genius being a woman, 
then the game is one for a king of 
critics: your George Sand becomes a 
mother to gain experience for the novel- 
ist and to develop her, and gobbles up 
men of genius, Chopins, Mussets and 
the like, as mere hors d’wuvres. 

Man and Superman, pp. xvil., xviil., xix. 


It is impossible to demonstrate that the 
initiative in sex transactions remains 
with Woman, and has been confirmed 
to her, so far, more and more by the 
suppression of rapine and discourage- 
ment of importunity, without being 
driven to very serious reflections on the 
fact that this initiative is politically the 
most important of all the initiatives, be- 
cause our political experiment of democ- 
racy, the last refuge of cheap misgov- 
ernment, will ruin us if our citizens are 
ill bred. Man and Superman, pp. xx1.,
