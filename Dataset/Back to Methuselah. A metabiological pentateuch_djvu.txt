PREFACE 
THE INFIDEL HALF CENTURY 


The Dawn of Darwinism 


One day early in the eighteen hundred and sixties, I, 
being then a small boy, was with my nurse, buying 
something in the shop of a petty newsagent, bookseller, 
and stationer: in Camden Street, Dublin, when there 
entered an elderly man, weighty and solemn, who ad- 
vanced to the counter, and said pompously, “Have you 
the works of the celebrated Buffoon?” 

My own works were at that time unwritten, or it 1s 
possible that the shop assistant might have misunder- 
stood me so far as to produce a copy of Man and 
Superman. As it was, she knew quite well what he 
wanted; for this was before the Education Act of 1870 
had produced shop assistants who know how to read and 
know nothing else. The celebrated Buffoon was not a 
humorist, but the famous naturalist Buffon. Every 
literate child at that time knew Buffon’s Natura] His- 
tory as well as Esop’s Fables. And no living child had 
heard the name that has since obliterated Buffon’s in the 
popular consciousness: the name of Darwin. 

Ten years elapsed. The celebrated Buffoon was for- 
gotten; I had doubled my years and my length; and I 
had discarded the religion of my forefathers. One day 
the richest and consequently most dogmatic of my uncles 
came into a restaurant where I was dining, and found 
himself, much against his will, in conversation with the 
most questionable of his nephews. By way of making 

vii 


te 


Vili Back to Methuselah 


myself agreeable, I spoke of modern thought and 
Darwin. He said, “Oh, thats the fellow who wants to 
make out that we all have tails like monkeys.” I tried 
to explain that what Darwin had insisted on in this con- 
nection was that some monkeys have no tails. But my 
uncle was as impervious to what Darwin really said as 
any Neo-Darwinian nowadays. He died impenitent, and 
did not mention me in his will. 

Twenty years elapsed. If my uncle had been alive, he 
would have known all about Darwin, and known it all 
wrong. In spite of the efforts of Grant Allen to set him 
right, he would have accepted Darwin as the discoverer 
of the Evolution, or Heredity, and of modification of 
species by Selection. For the pre-Darwinian age had 
come to be regarded as a Dark Age in which men still 
believed that the book of Genesis was a standard scientific 
treatise, and that the only additions to it were Galileo’s 
demonstration of Leonardo da Vinci’s simple remark 
that the earth is a moon of the sun, Newton’s theory of 
gravitation, Sir Humphry Davy’s invention of the 
safety-lamp, the discovery of electricity, the application 
of steam to industrial purposes, and the penny post. It 
was just the same in other subjects. Thus Nietzsche, by 
the two or three who had come across his writings, was 
supposed to have been the first man to whom it occurred 
that mere morality and legality and urbanity lead 
nowhere, as if Bunyan ‘had never written Badman. 
Schopenhauer was credited with inventing the distinction 
between the Covenant of Grace and the Covenant of 
Works which troubled Cromwell on his deathbed. People 
talked as if there had been no dramatic or descriptive 
music before Wagner; no impressionist painting before 
Whistler; whilst as to myself, I was finding that the 
surest way to produce an effect of daring innovation and 
originality was to revive the ancient attraction of long 


Back to Methuselah 1x 


rhetorical speeches; to stick closely to the methods of 
Moliére; and to lift characters bodily out of the pages 
of Charles Dickens. 


The Advent of the Neo-Darwinians 


This particular sort of ignorance does not always or 
often matter. But in Darwin’s case it did matter. If 
Darwin had really led the world at one bound from the 
book of Genesis to Heredity, to Modification of Species 
by Selection, and to Evolution, he would have been a 
Philosopher and a prophet as well as an eminent pro- 
fessional naturalist, with geology as a hobby. The 
delusion that he had actually achieved this feat did no 
harm at first, because if people’s views are sound, about 
evolution or anything else, 1t does not make two straws 
difference whether they call the revealer of their views 
Tom or Dick. But later on such apparently negligible 
errors have awkward consequences. Darwin was given 
an imposing reputation as not only an Evolutionist, but 
as the Evolutionist, with the immense majority who never 
read his books. The few who never read any others 
were led by them to concentrate exclusively on Circum- 
stantial Selection as the explanation of all the trans- 
formations and adaptations which were the evidence for 
Evolution. And they presently found themselves so cut 
off by this specialization from the majority who knew 
Darwin only by his spurious reputation, that they were 
obliged to distinguish themselves, not as Darwinians, but 
as Neo-Darwinians. | 

Before ten more years had elapsed, the Neo-Dar- 
winians were practically running current Science. It 
was 1906; I was fifty; I had published my own view of 
evolution in a play called Man and Superman; and I 
found that most people were unable to understand how 


x Back to Methuselah 


I could be an Evolutionist and not a Neo-Darwinian, or 
why I habitually derided Neo-Darwinism as a ghastly 
idiocy, and would fall on its professors slaughterously 1m 
public discussions. It was in the hope of making’ me 
clear the matter up that the Fabian Society, which was 
then organizing a series of lectures on Prophets of the 
Nineteenth Century, asked me to deliver a lecture on the 
prophet Darwin. I did so; and scraps of that lecture, 
which was never published, variegate these pages. 


Political Inadequacy of the Human Animal 


Ten more years elapsed. Neo-Darwinism in politics 
had produced a European catastrophe of a magnitude 
so appalling, and a scope so unpredictable, that as I 
write these lines in 1920, it is still far from certain 
whether our civilization will survive it. The circum- 
stances of this catastrophe, the boyish cinema-fed 
romanticism which made it possible to impose it on the 
people as a crusade, and especially the ignorance and 
errors of the victors of Western Europe when tts violent 
phase had passed and the time for reconstruction 
arrived, confirmed a doubt which had grown steadily in 
my mind during my forty years’? public work as a 

Socialist: namely, whether the human animal, as he 
exists at present, 1s capable of solving the social 
problems raised by his own aggregation, or, as he calls 
it, his civilization. 


Cowardice of the Irreligious 


Another observation I had made was that good- 
natured unambitious men are cowards when they have no 
religion. ‘They are dominated and exploited not only 
by greedy and often half-witted and half-alive weak- 
lings who will do anything for cigars, champagne, motor 


Back to Methuselah xi 


cars, and the more childish and selfish uses of money, but 
by able and sound administrators who can do nothing 
else with them than dominate and exploit them. Govern- 
ment and exploitation become synonymous under such 
circumstances; and the world is finally ruled by the 
childish, the brigands, and the blackguards. Those who 
refuse to stand in with them are persecuted and occa- 
sionally executed when they give any trouble to the 
exploiters. They fall into poverty when they lack 
lucrative specific talents. At the present moment one 
half of Europe, having knocked the other half down, is 
trying to kick it to death, and may succeed: a pro- 
cedure which is, logically, sound Neo-Darwinism. And 
the good-natured majority are looking on in helpless 
horror, or allowing themselves to be persuaded by the 
newspapers of their exploiters that the kicking is not 
only a sound commercial investment, but an act of divine 
justice of which they are the ardent instruments. 

But if Man is really incapable of organizing a big 
civilization, and cannot organize even a village or a tribe 
any too well, what is the use of giving him a religion? 
A religion may make him hunger and thirst for right- 
eousness; but will it endow him with the practical 
capacity to satisfy that appetite? Good intentions do 
not carry with them a grain of political science, which 
is a very complicated one. The most devoted and inde- 
fatigable, the most able and disinterested students of this 
science in England, as far as I know, are my friends 
Sidney and Beatrice Webb. It has taken them forty 
years of preliminary work, in the course of which they 
have published several treatises comparable to Adam 
Smith’s Wealth of Nations, to formulate a political con- 
struction adequate to existing needs. If this is the 
measure of what can be done in a lifetime by extraordi- 
nary ability, keen natural aptitude, exceptional oppor- 


' 


? 


xi Back to Methuselah 


tunities, and freedom from the preoccupations of bread- 
winning, what are we to expect from the parliament man 
to whom political science is as remote and distasteful as 
the differential calculus, and to whom such an elementary 
but vital point as the law of economic rent is a pons 
asinorum never to be approached, much less crossed? Or 
from the common voter who is mostly so hard at work all 
day earning a living that he cannot keep awake for five 
minutes over a book? 


Is There Any Hope in Education? 


The usual answer is that we must educate our masters: 
that is, ourselves, We must teach citizenship and 
political science at school. But must we? There is no 
must about it, the hard fact being that we must not 
teach political science or citizenship at schoo]. The 
schoolmaster who attempted it Would soon find himself 
penniless in the streets without pupils, if not in the dock 
pleading to a pompously worded indictment for sedition 
against the exploiters. Our schools teach the morality 
of feudalism corrupted by commercialism, and hold up 
the military conqueror, the robber baron, and the 
profiteer, as models of the illustrious and the successful. 
In vain do the prophets who see through this imposture 
preach and teach a better gospel: the individuals whom 
they convert are doomed to pass away in a few years; 
and the new generations are dragged back in the schools 
to the morality of the fifteenth century, and think them- 
selves Liberal when they are defending the ideas of 
Henry VII, and gentlemanly when they are opposing to 
them the ideas of Richard III. Thus the educated man 
is a greater nuisance than the uneducated one: indeed 
it is the inefficiency and sham of the educational side of 
our schools (to which, except under compulsion, children 


Back to Methuselah X11 


vould not be sent by their parents at all if they did not 
ict as prisons in which the immature are kept from 
vorrying the mature) that save us from being dashed 
m the rocks of false doctrine instead of drifting down 
he midstream of mere ignorance. There is no way out 
hrough the schoolmaster. 


Homeopathic Education 


In truth, mankind cannot be saved from without, by 
choolmasters or any other sort of masters: it can only 
1e lamed and enslaved by them. It is said that if you 
vash a cat it will never again wash itself. This may or 
nay not be true: what is certain is that if you teach a 
nan anything he will never learn it; and if you cure him 
f a disease he will be unable to cure himself the next 
ime it attacks him. Therefore, if you want to see a cat 
‘lean, you throw a bucket of mud over it, when it will 
mmediately take extraordinary pains to lick the mud 
ff, and finally be cleaner than it was before. In the 
ame way doctors who are up-to-date (say .00005 per 
ent of all the registered practitioners, and 20 per cent 
£ the unregistered ones), when they want to rid you of 
, disease or a symptom, inoculate you with that disease 
i give you a drug that produces that symptom, in order 
o provoke you to resist it as the mud provokes the cat 
o wash itself, 

Now an acute person will at once ask why, if this be so, 
uur false education does not provoke our scholars to find 
mut the truth. The answer is partly that it does. 
Toltaire was a pupil of the Jesuits; Samuel Butler was 
he pupil of a hopelessly conventional and erroneous 
ountry parson. But then Voltaire was Voltaire, and 
Jutler was Butler: that is, their minds were so ab- 
ormally strong that they could throw off the doses of 
joison that paralyse ordinary minds. When the doctors 


XxiV Back to Methuselah 


ey 
inoculate you and the homeopathists dose you, they givé 
you an infinitesimally attenuated dose. If they gave you 
the virus at full strength it would overcome your resist- 
ance and produce its direct effect. The doses of false 
doctrine given at public schools and universities, are so 
big that they overwhelm the resistance that aAiny dose 
would provoke. The normal student is corrupted beyond 
redemption, and will drive the genius who resists out of 
the country if he can. Byron and Shelley had to fly to 
Italy, whilst Castlereagh and Eldon ruled the roost at 
home. Rousseau was hunted from frontier to frontier; 
Karl Marx starved in exile in a Soho lodging; Ruskin’s 
articles were refused by the magazines (he was too rich 
to be otherwise persecuted); whilst mindless forgotten 
nonentities governed the land; sent men to the prison or 
the gallows for blasphemy and sedition (meaning the 
truth about Church and State); and sedulously stored 
up the social disease and corruption which explode from 
time to time in gigantic boils that have to be lanced by 
a million bayonets. This is the result of allopathic edu- 
cation. Homeopathic education has not yet been 
officially tried, and would obviously be a delicate matter 
if it were. A body of schoolmasters inciting their pupils 
to infinitesimal peccadilloes with the object of provoking 
them to exclaim, “Get thee behind me, Satan,” or telling 
them white lies about history for the sake of being con- 
tradicted, insulted, and refuted, would certainly do less 
harm than our present educational allopaths do; but 
then nobody will advocate homeopathic education. ‘Allo- 
pathy ‘thas produced the poisonous illusion that it 
enlightens instead of darkening. The suggestion may, 
however, explain why, whilst most people’s minds suc- 
cumb to inculcation and environment, a few react vigor- 
ously: honest and decent people coming from thievish 
slums, and sceptics and realists from country parsonages.

¥ The Diabolical Efficiency of ‘Technical 
= Education 


But meanwhile—and here comes the horror of it—our 
echnical instruction is honest and efficient. The public 
ichoolboy who is carefully blinded, duped, and corrupted 
is to the nature of a society based on profiteering, and 
s taught to honor parisitic idleness and luxury, learns 
io shoot and ride and keep fit with all the assistance and 
guidance that can be procured for him by the most 
ixiously sincere desire that he may do these things 
vell, and if possible superlatively well. In the army he 
earns to fly; to drop bombs; to use machine-guns to the 
itmost of his capacity. The discovery of high ex- 
slosives is rewarded and dignified: instruction in the 
nanufacture of the weapons, Lattleships, submarines, 
ind land batteries by which they are applied destruc- 
‘ively, is quite genuine: the instructors know their 
jusiness, and really mean the learners to succeed. The. 
result is that powers of destruction that could hardly 
without uneasiness be entrusted to infinite wisdom and 
nfinite benevolence are placed in the hands of romantic 
ichoolboy patriots who, however generous by nature, are 
yy education ignoramuses, dupes, snobs, and sportsmen 
;o whom fighting is a religion and killing an accomplish- 
nent; whilst political power, useless under such circum- 
stances except to militarist imperialists in chronic terror 
»f invasion and subjugation, pompous tufthunting fools, 
sommercial adventurers to whom the organization by the 
1ation of its own industrial services would mean check- 
nate, financial parasites on the money market, and 
nerely stupid conservators of everything that exists 
nerely because they are used to it, is obtained by 
ieredity, by simple purchase, by keeping newspapers 
ind pretending that they are organs of public opinion, 


XV1 Back to Methuselah 


by the wiles of seductive women, and by prostituting 
ambitious talent to the service of the profiteers, who call 
the tune because, having secured all the spare plunder, 
they alone can afford to pay the piper. Neither the 
rulers nor the ruled understand high politics. They do 
not even know that there is such a branch of knowledge 
as political science; but between them they can coerce 
and enslave with the deadliest efficiency, even to the 
wiping out of civilization, because their education as 
slayers has been honestly and thoroughly carried out. 
Essentially the rulers are all defectives; and there is 
nothing worse than government by defectives who wield 
irresistible powers of physical coercion. The common- 
place sound people submit, and compel the rest to sub- 
mit, because they have been taught to do so as an article 
of religion and a point of honor. ‘Those in whom 
natural enlightenment has reacted against artificial 
education submit because they are compelled; but they 
would resist, and finally resist effectively, if they were 
not cowards. And they are cowards because they have 
neither an officially accredited and established religion 
nor a generally recognized point of honor, and are all at 
sixes and sevens with their various private speculations, 
sending their children perforce to the schools where they 
will be corrupted for want of any other schools. The 
rulers are equally intimidated by the immense extension 
and cheapening of the means of slaughter and destruc- 
tion. The British Government is more afraid of Ireland 
now that submarines, bombs, and poison gas are cheap 
and easily made than it was of the German Empire 
before the war; consequently the old British caution 
which maintaineed a balance of power through command 
of the sea is intensified into a terror that sees security in 
nothing short of absolute military mastery of the entire 
globe: that is, in an impossibility that will yet seem pos- 


Back to Methuselah XVli 


sible in detail to soldiers and to parochial and insular 
patriotic civilians, 


Flimsiness of Civilization 


This situation has occurred so often before, always 
with the same result of a collapse of civilization (Pro- 
fessor Flinders Petrie has let out the secret of previous 
collapses), that the rich are instinctively crying ‘Let 
us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die,” and the poor, 
“How long, O Lord, how long?” But the pitiless reply 
still is that God helps those who help themselves. This 
does not mean that if Man cannot find the remedy no 
remedy will be found. The power that produced Man 
when the monkey was not up to the mark, can produce a 
higher creature than Man if Man does not come up to 
the mark. What it means is that if Man is to be saved, 
Man must save himself. ‘There seems no compelling ~ 
reason why he should be saved. He is by no means an 
ideal creature. At his present best many of his ways | 
are so unpleasant that they are unmentionable in polite 
society, and so painful that he is compelled to pretend 
that pain is often a good. Nature holds no brief for 
the human experiment: it must stand or fall by its 
results. If Man will not serve, Nature will try another | 
experiment. 

What hope is there then of human improvement? 
According to the Neo-Darwinists, to the Mechanists, no 
hope whatever, because improvement can come only 
through some senseless accident which must, on the 
statistical average of accidents, be presently wiped out 
by some other equally senseless accident. 


Creative Evolution 


But this dismal creed does not discourage those who 
believe that the impulse that produces evolution is 


XVvili Back to Methuselah 


creative. They have observed the simple fact that the 
will to do anything can and does, at a certain pitch of 
intensity set up by conviction of its necessity, create and 
organize new tissue to do it with. To them therefore 
mankind is by no means played out yet. If the weight 
lifter, under the trivial stimulus of an athletic compe- 
tition, can “put up a muscle,’ it seems reasonable to 
believe that an equally earnest and convinced philosopher 
could “put up a brain.” Both are directions of vitality 
to a certain end. Evolution shows us this direction of 
vitality doing all sorts of things: providing the centi- 
pede with a hundred legs, and ridding the fish of any 
legs at all; building lungs and arms for the land and 
gills and fins for the sea; enabling the mammal to 
gestate its young inside its body, and the fowl to incu- 
bate hers outside it; offering us, we may say, our choice 
of any sort of bodily contrivance to maintain our 
activity and increase our resources. 


Voluntary Longevity 


Among other matters apparently changeable at will 
is the duration of individual life. Weismann, a very 
clever and suggestive biologist who was unhappily re- 
duced to idiocy by Neo-Darwinism, pointed out that 
death is not an eternal condition of life, but an ex- 
pedient introduced to provide for continual renewal 
without overcrowding. Now Circumstantial Selection 
does not account for natural death: it accounts only for 
the survival of species in which the individuals have 
sense enough to decay and die on purpose. But the 
individuals do not seem to have calculated very reason- 
ably: nobody can explain why a parrot should live ten 
times as long as a dog, and a turtle be almost immortal. 
In the case of man, the operation has overshot its mark: 
men do not live long enough: they are, for all the pur-

‘ 

poses of high civilization, mere children when they die; 
and our Prime Ministers, though rated as mature, divide 

their time between the golf course and the Treasury. 

Bench in parliament. Presumably, however, the same 

power that made this mistake can remedy it. If on 

opportunist grounds Man now fixes the term of his life 
at three score and ten years, he can equally fix it at 
three hundred, or three thousand, or even at the genuine 

Circumstantial Selection limit, which would be until a 

sooner-or-later-inevitable fatal accident makes an end 

of the individual. All that is necessary to make him 
extend his present span is that tremendous catastrophes 
such as the late war shall convince him of the necessity 
of at least outliving his taste for golf and cigars if the 
race is to be saved. This is not fantastic speculation: 
it is deductive biology, if there 1s such a science as 
biology. Here, then, is a stone what we have left un- 
turned, and that may be worth turnmg. To make the 
a\“yeestion more entertaining than it would be to most 

. pple in the form of a biological treatise, I have written 

ck to Methuselah as a contribution to the modern 

Able. 

Maity people, however, can read treatises and cannot 
read Bibles. Darwin could not read Shakespear. Some 
wiho can read both, like to learn the history of their 
ideas. Some are so entangled in the current confusion 

f Creative Evolution with Circumstantial Selection by 

‘their historical ignorance that they are puzzled by any 

| distinction between the two. For all their sakes I must 

\ give here a little history of the conflict between the view 


ee 


of Evolution taken by the Darwinians. (though: not 
altogether by Darwin himself.) and.called Natural Selec- 
tion, and that which is emerging, under the title of 
Creative Evolution, as the genuinely scientific religion 
for which all wise men are now anxiously looking.

blood relations, he began the sort of classification 
which, when extended by Darwin to monkeys and men, 
so shocked my uncle. 

Genesis had held the field until the time (1'707-1778) 
of Linneus the famous botanist. In the meantime the 
microscope had been invented. It revealed a new world of 
hitherto invisible creatures called Infusorians, as com- 
mon water was found to be an infusion of them. In the 
eighteenth century naturalists were very keen on the 
Infusorian Ameebas, and were much struck by the way 
in which the members of this old family behaved and 
developed. But it was still possible for Linneus to begin 
a treatise by saying “There are just so many species as 
there were forms created in the beginning,” though 
there were hundreds of commonplace Scotch gardeners, 
pigeon fanciers, and stock breeders then living who knew 
better. Linneus himself knew better before he died. In 
the last edition of his System of Nature, he began to 
wonder whether the transmutation of species by varia- 
tion might not be possible. Then came the great poet 
who jumped over the facts to the conclusion. Goethe 
said that all the shapes of creation were cousins; that 
there must be some common stock from which all the 
species had sprung; that it was the environment of air 
that had produced the eagle, of water the seal, and of 
earth the mole. He could not say how this happened; 
but he divined that it did happen. Erasmus Darwin, the : 
grandfather of Charles, carried the environment theory 
much further, pointing out instance after instance of 
modifications made in species apparently to adapt it to 
circumstances and environment: for instance, that the 
brilliant colours of the leopard, which make it so con- 
spicuous in Regent’s Park, conceal it in a tropical 
jungle. Finally he wrote, as his declaration of faith, 
“The world has been evolved, not created: it has arisen 


XXli Back to Methuselah 


little by little from a small beginning, and has increased 
through the activity of the elemental forces embodied in 
itself, and so has rather grown than come into being at 
an almighty word. What a sublime idea of the infinite 
might of the great ‘Architect, the Cause of all causes, 
the Father of all fathers, the Ens Entium! For if we , 
would compare the Infinite, it would surely require a/ 
greater Infinite to cause the causes of effects than to 
produce the effects themselves.”? In this, published 1n , 
the year 194, you have nineteenth-century Evolution i 
precisely defined. And Erasmus Darwin was by no 
means its only apostle. It was in the air then. A Ger- 
man biologist named Treviranus, whose book was pub- 
lished in 1802, wrote, “In every living being there exists 
a capacity for endless diversity of form. Each possesses 
the power of adapting its organization to the variations 
of the external world; and it is this power, called into 
activity by cosmic changes, which has enabled the simple 
zoophytes of the primitive world to climb to higher and 
higher stages of organization, and has brought endless 
variety into nature.” There you have your evolution of 
Man from the ameba all complete whilst Nelson was still 
alive on the seas. And in 1809, before the battle of 
Waterloo, a French soldier named Lamarck, who had 
‘beaten his musket into a microscope and turned 

zooloist, declared that species were an illusion produced 
by the shortness of our individual lives, and that they 
were constantly changing and melting into one another 
and into new forms as surely as the hand of a clock is 
continually moving, though it moves so slowly that it 
looks stationary to us. We have since come to think 
- that its industry is less continuous: that the clock stops 
for a long time, and then is suddenly “put on” by a 
mysterious finger. But never mind that just at 
present.

The Advent of the Neo-Lamarckians 


I call your special attention to Lamarck, because later 
on there were Neo-Lamarckians as well as Neo-Dar- 
winians. I was a Neo-Lamarckian. Lamarck passed 
on from the conception of Evolution as a general law to 
Charles Darwin’s department of it, which was the 
method of Evolution. Lamarck, whilst making many 
ingenious suggestions as to the reaction of external 
causes on life and habit, such as changes of climate, food 
supply, geological upheavals and_so forth, really held 
as his furidamental_ proposition that living organisms _ 
changed because they wanted to..As Rebate ted it, the 
great factor in Evolution is use and disusé. Ifyou have 
no eyes, and want to see, and keep trying te see, you wil). 
finally get eyes. If, like a mole or subterranean fish, 
you have eyes and dont want to see, you will lose your 
eyes. If you like eating the tender tops of trees enough 
to make you concentrate all your energies on the stretch- 
ing of your neck, you will finally get a long neck, like 
the giraffe. This seems absurd to inconsiderate people 
at the first blush; but it is within the personal experi- 
ence of all of us that it is just by this process that a 
child tumbling about the floor becomes a boy walking 
erect; and that a man sprawling on the road with a 
bruised chin, or supine on the ice with a bashed occiput, 
becomes a bicyclist and a skater. ‘The process is not 
continuous, as it would be if mere practice had anything 
to do with it; for though you may improve at each 
bicycling lesson during the lesson, when you begin your 
next lesson you do not begin at the point at which you 
left off: you relapse apparently to the beginning. 
Finally, yoa succeed quite suddenly, and do not relapse 
again. More miraculous still, you at once exercise the 
new power unconsciously. Although you are adapting 


XX1V Back to Methuselah 


your front wheel to your balance so elaborately and 
actively that the accidental locking of your handle bars 
for a second will throw you off; though five minutes 
before you could not do it at all, yet now you do it as 
unconsciously as you grow your finger nails. You have 
a new faculty, and must have created some new bodily 
tissue as its organ. And you have done it solely by 
willing. For here there can be no question of Circum- 
stantial Selection, or the survival of the fittest. The 
man who is learning how to ride a bicycle has no advan- 
tage over the non-cyclist in the struggle for existence: 
quite the contrary. He has acquired a new habit, an 
automatic unconscious habit, solely because he wanted 
to, and kept trying until it was added into him. 


How Acquirements are Inherited 


But when your son tries to skate or bicycle in his turn, 
he does not pick up the accomplishment where you left 
it, any more than he is born six feet high with a beard 
and a tall hat. The set-back that occurred between your 
lessons occurs again. The race learns exactly as the 
individual learns. Your son relapses, not to the very 
beginning, but to a point which no mortal method of 
measurement can distinguish from the beginning. Now 
this is odd; for certain other habits of yours, equally 
acquired (to the Evolutionist, of course, all habits are 
acquired), equally unconscious, equally automatic, are 
transmitted without any perceptible relapse. For in- 
stance, the very first act of your son when he enters the 
world as a separate individual is to yell with indigna- 
tion : that yell which Shakespear thought the most tragic 
and piteous of all sounds. In the act of yelling he 
begins to breathe: another habit, and not even a neces- 
sary one, as the object of breathing can be achieved in 


Back to Methuselah XXV 


jher ways, as by deep sea fishes. He circulates his 
ood by pumping it with his heart. He demands a meal, 
ad proceeds at once to perform the most elaborate chem- 
al operations on the food he swallows. He manufac- 
ires teeth; discards them; and replaces them with fresh 
aes. Compared to these habitual feats, walking, stand- 
g upright, and bicycling are the merest trifles; yet it 

only by going through the wanting, trying process 
iat he can stand, walk, or cycle, whereas in the other 
ad far more difficult and complex habits he not only 
es not consciously want nor consciously try, but actu- 
ly consciously objects very strongly. Take that early 
abit of cutting the teeth; would he do that if he could 
1p it? Take that later habit of decaying and elimi- 
vting himself by death—equally as acquired habit, re- 
ember—how he abhors it! Yet the habit has become 

» rooted, so automatic, that he must do it in spite of 
imself, even to his own destruction. 

We have here a routine which, given time enough for 

te operate, will finally produce the most elaborate 
yrms of organized life on Lamarckian lines without 
ie intervention of Circumstantial Selection at all. If 
ou can turn a pedestrian into a cyclist, and a cyclist 
ito a pianist or violinist, without the intervention of 
ircumstantial Selection, you can turn an ameba into 
man, or a man into a superman, without it. All of 

hich is rank heresy to the Neo-Darwinian, who im- 
rines that if you stop Circumstantial Selection, you not 
aty stop development but inaugurate a rapid and disas- | 
‘ous degeneration. 

Let us fix the Lamarckian evolutionary process well 
1 our minds. You are alive; and you want to be more 
live. You want an extension of consciousness and of 
ower. You want, consequently, additional organs, or 
Iditional uses of your existing organs: that is, addi- 


XXVI1 Back to Methuselah 


tional habits. You get them because you want them 
badly endugh to keep trying for them until they come. 
Nobody knows how: nobody knows why: all we know is 
that the thing actually takes place. We relapse miser- 
ably from effort to effort until the old organ is modi- 
fied or the new one created, when suddenly the impossible 
becomes possible and the habit is formed. ‘The moment 
we form it we want to get rid of the consciousness of it 
so as to economize our consciousness for fresh conquests 
of life; as all consciousness means preoccupation and 
obstruction. If we had to think about breathing or 
digesting or circulating our blood we should have no 
attention to spare for anything else, as we find to our 
-cost when anything goes wrong with these operations. 
We want to he unconscious of them just as we wanted to 
acquire them; and we finally win what we want. But we 
win unconsciousness of our habits at the cost of losing 
our control of them; and we also build one habit and its 
corresponding functional modification of our organs on 
another, and so become dependent on our old habits. 
Consequently we hhave to persist in them even when they 
hurt us. We cannot stop breathing to avoid an attack 
of asthma, or to escape drowning. We can lose a habit 
and discard an organ when we no longer need them, just 
as we acquired them; but this process is slow and broken 
by relapses; and relics of the organ and the habit long 
survive its utility. And if other and still indispensable 
habits and modifications have been built on the ones we 
wish to discard, we must provide a new foundation for 
them before we demolish the old one. This is also a slow 
process and a very curious one. 


The Miracle of Condensed Recapitulation 


The relapses between the efforts to acquire a habit are 
important because, as we have seen, they recur not only 


Back to Methuselah XXVIi 


‘om effort to effort in the case of the individual, but 
rom generation to generation in the case of the race. 
‘his relapsing from generation to generation is an in- 
ariable characteristic of the evolutionary process. For 
istance, Raphael, though descended from eight unin- 
rupted generations of painters, had to learn to paint 
pparently as if no Sanzio had ever handled a brush 
2fore. But he had also to learn to breathe, and digest, 
nd circulate his hlood. Although his father and mother 
ere fully grown adults when he was conceived, he was 
ot conceived or even born fully grown; he had to go 
ack and begin as a speck of protoplasm, and to strug- 
le through an embryonic lifetime, during part of which 
2 was Indistinguishable from an embryonic dog, and 
ad neither a skull nor a backbone. When he at last 
equired these articles, he was for some time doubtful 
hether he was a bird or a fish. He had to compress 
ntold centuries of development into nine months before 
2 was human enough to break loose as an independent 
2mg. And even then he was still so incomplete that his 
arents might well have exclaimed “Good Heavens! have 
ou learnt nothing from our experience that you come 
ito the world in this ridiculously elementary state? 
Vhy cant you talk and walk and paint and behave 
ecently?” To that question Baby Raphael had no 
nswer. ‘All the could have said was that this is how 
olution or transformation happens. The time may, 
yme when the same force that compressed the develop-: 
ent of millions of years into nine months may pack 
iany more millions into even a shorter space; so that 
aphaels may be born painters as they are now born 
reathers and blood circulators. But they will still 
2g9in as specks of protoplasm, and acquire the faculty 
f painting in their mother’s womb at quite a late stage 
f their embryonic life. They must recapitulate the 


XXVIll Back to Methuselah 


history of mankind in their own persons, however briefly 
they may condense it. ; 
Nothing was so astonishing and significant in the dis- _ 
coveries of the embryologists, nor anything so absurdly , 
little appreciated, as this recapitulation, as it is now 
called: this power of hurrying up into months a process 
which was once so long and tedious that the mere con- 
templation of it is unendurable by men whose span of 
life is three-score-and-ten. It widened human possibilt- 
ties to the extent of enabling us to hope that the most 
prolonged and difficult operations of our minds may yet 
become instantaneous, or, as we call it, instinctive. gIt 
also directed our attention to examples of this packing 
up of centuries into seconds which were staring us in the 
face in all directions. As I write these lines the news- 
papers are occupied by the exploits of a child of eight, 
who has just defeated twenty adult chess players in 
twenty games played simultaneously, and has been able 
afterwards to reconstruct all the twenty games without 
any apparent effort of memory. Most people, includ- 
ing myself, play chess (when they play it at all) from 
hand to mouth, and can hardly recall the last move but 
one, or foresee the next but two. Also, when I have to 
make an arithmetical caluclation, I have to do it step 
by step with pencil and paper, slowly, reluctantly, and 
with so little confidence in the result that I dare not act 
on it without “proving” the sum by a further calcula- 
tion involving more ciphering. But there are men who 
can neither read, write, nor cipher, to whom the answer 
to such sums as I can do is instantly obvious without 
any conscious calculation at all; and the result is infal- 
lible. Yet some of these natural arithmeticians have but 
a small vocabulary; are at a loss when they have to find 
words for any but the simplest everyday occasions: and 
cannot for the life of them describe mechanical opera- 


Back to Methuselah XX1X 


ions which they perform daily in ‘the course of their 
‘rade; whereas (to me the whole vocabulary of English 
iterature, from Shakespear to the latest edition of the 
Encyclopedia Britannica, is so completely and instanta- 
leously at my call that I have never had to consult even 
. thesaurus except once or twice when for some reason I 
vanted a third or fourth synonym. \“Again, though I 
iave tried and failed to draw recognizable portraits of 
yersons I have seen every day for years, Mr. Bernard 
Partridge, having seen a man once, will, without more 
‘train than is involved in eating a sandwich, draw him 
o the life. The keyboard of a piano is a device I have 
1ever been able to master; yet Mr. Cyril Scott uses it 
‘xactly as I use my own fingers; and to Sir Edward 
ilgar an orchestral score is as instantaneously intel- 
igible at sight as a page of Shakespear is to me. One 
nan cannot, after trying for years, finger the flute 
luently. Another will take up a flute with a newly 
nvented arrangement of keys on it, and play it at once 
vith hardly a mistake. We find people to whom writing 
s so difficult that they prefer to sign their name with a 
nark, and beside them men who master systems of short- 
1and and improvise new systems of their own as easily 
is they learnt the alphabet. These contrasts are to be 
een on all hands, and have nothing to do with varia- 
ions in general intelligence, nor even in the specialized 
ntelligence proper to the faculty in question: for ex- 
imple, no composer or dramatic poet has ever pretended 
o be able to perform all the parts he writes for the 
ingers, actors, and players who are his executants. 
Ine might as well expect Napoleon to be a fencer, or the 
\stronomer Royal to know how many beans make five 
ny better than his bookkeeper. (Bre exceptional 
ommand of language does not imply the possession of 
Jeas to express: Mezzofanti, the master of fifty-eight 


XXX Back to Methuselah 


languages, had less to say in them than Shakespear 
with his little Latin and less Greek; and public life 1s 
the paradise of voluble windbags. 

All these examples, which might be multiplied by mil- 
lions, are cases in which a long, laborious, conscious, 
detailed process of. acquirement has been condensed into 
an instinctive and unconscious inborn one. Factors 
which formerly had to be considered one by one in suc- 
cession are integrated into what seems a single simple 
factor. Chains of hardly soluble problems have coalesced 
in one problem which solves itself the moment it is raised. 
What is more, they have been pushed back (or forward, 
if you like) from post-natal to pre-natal ones. The 
child in the womb may take some time over them; but it 
is a miraculously shortened time. 

The time phenomena involved are curious, and suggest 
that we are either wrong about our history or else that 
we enormously exaggerate the periods required for the 
pre-natal acquirement of habits. In the nineteenth cen- 
tury we talked very. glibly about geological periods, and 
flung millions of coins about in the most lordly manner 
In our reaction against Archbishop Ussher’s chronology. 
We had a craze for big figures, and positively liked to 
believe that the progress made by the child in the womb 
in a month was represented in prehistoric time by ages 
and ages. We insisted that Evolution advanced more 
slowly than any snail ever crawled, and that Nature does 
not proceed by leaps and bounds. This was all very well 
as long as we were dealing with such acquired habits as 
breathing or digestion. It was possible to believe that 
dozens of epochs thad gone to the slow building up of 
these habits. But when we have to consider the case 
of a man born not only as an accomplished metabolist, 
but with such an aptitude for shorthand and keyboard 
manipulation that he is a stenographer or pianist at 


Back to Methuselah XXxl 


east five sixths ready-made as soon as he can control his 
.ands intelligently, we are forced to suspect either that 
‘eyboards and shorthand are older inventions than we 
uppose, or else that acquirements can be assimilated 
ind stored as congenial qualifications in a shorter time 
han we think; so that, as between Lyell and Archbishop 
Jssher, the laugh may not be with Lyell quite so up- 
‘oariously as it seemed fifty years ago. 


Heredity an Old Story 


It is evident that the evolutionary process is a heredi- 
ary one, or, to put it less drily, that human life is con- 
inuous and immortal. The Evolutionists took heredity 
or granted. So did everybody. The human mind has 
een soaked in heredity as long back as we can trace 
ts thought. Hereditary peers, hereditary monarchs, 
iereditary castes and trades and classes were the best 
‘nown of social institutions, and in some cases of public 
\uisances. Pedigree men counted pedigree dogs and 
vedigree horses among their most cherished possessions. 
“ar from being unconscious of heredity, or sceptical, 
nen were insanely credulous about it: they not only 
ielieved in the transmission of qualities and habits from 
reneration to generation, but expected the son to begin 
aentally where the father left off. 

This belief in heredity led naturally to the practice of 
ntentional Selection. Good blood and breeding were 
agerly sought after in human marriage. In dealing 
rith plants and animals, selection with a view to the 
moduction of new varieties and the improvement and 
10dification of species ‘had been practised ever since men 
egan to cultivate them. My pre-Darwinian uncle knew 
s well as Darwin that the race-horse and the dray- 
orse are not separate creations from the Garden of 


XXxii Back to Methuselah 


Eden, but adaptations by deliberate human selection of 
the medieval war-horse to modern racing and industrial 
haulage. He knew that there are nearly two hundred 
different sorts of dogs, all capable of breeding with one 
another and of producing cross varieties unknown to 
Adam. He knew that the same thing is true of pigeons. 
He knew that gardeners had spent their lives trying to 
breed black tulips and green carnations and unheard-of 
orchids, and had actually produced flowers just as 
strange to Eve. His quarrel with the Evolutionists was 
not a quarrel with the evidence for Evolution: he had 
accepted enough of it to prove Evolution ten times over 
before he ever heard of it. What he repudiated was 
cousinship with the ape, and the implied suspicion of a 
rudimentary tail, because it was offensive to his sense 
of his own dignity, and because he thought that apes 
were ridiculous, and tails diabolical when associated with 
the erect posture. Also he believed that Evolution was 
a heresy which involved the destruction of Christianity, 
of which, as a member of the Irish Church (the pseudo- 
Protestant one), he conceived himself a pillar. But this 
was only his ignorance; for a man may deny his descent 
from an ape and be eligible as a churchwarden without 
being any the less a convinced Evolutionist. 


Discovery Anticipated by Divination 


What is more, the religious folk can claim to be 
among the pioneers of Evolutionism. Weismann, Neo- 
Darwinist though he was, devoted a long passage in his 
History of Evolution to the Nature Philosophy of 
Lorenz Oken, published in 1809. Oken defined natural 
science as “the science of the everlasting transmutations 
of the Holy Ghost in the world.” His religion had 
started him on the right track, and not only led him to 


Back to Methuselah XXXIll 


think out a whole scheme of Evolution in abstract terms, 
but guided his aim in a significantly good scientific shot 
which brought him within the scope of Weismann. He 
not only defined the original substance from which all 
forms of life have developed as protoplasm, or, as he 
called it, primitive slime (Urschleim), but actually de- 
clared that this slime took the form of vesicles out of 
which the universe was built. Here was the modern cell 
morphology guessed by a religions thinker long before 
the microscope and the scalpel forced it on the vision of 
mere laboratory workers who could not think and had no 
religion. The laboratory workers worked very hard 
indeed to find out what would happen to a dog if they 
tied up its bile ducts, or to a monkey if half its brains 
were burnt out by a man with no brains at all, much as a 
child will pull off a fly’s legs to see what will happen 
to the fly. Lorenz Oken thought very hard to find out 
what was happening to the Holy Ghost, and thereby 
made a contribution of extraordinary importance to our 
understanding of creatures having nothing wrong with 
their bile ducts or brains. The man who was scientific 
enough to see that the Holy Ghost is the most inter- 
esting of all the hard facts of life got easily in front 
of the blockheads who could only sin against it. Hence 
my uncle was turning his back on very respectable com- 
pany when he derided Evolution, and would probably 
have recanted and apologized at once had anybody 
pointed out to him what a solecism he was committing. 
The metaphysical side of Evolution was thns no nov- 
elty when Darwin arrived. Had Oxen never lived, there 
would still have been millions of persons trained from 
their childhood to believe that we are continually urged 
upwards by a force called the Will of God. dn_1819— 


Schopenhauer publishhee his treatise on The-World as 
Will, which is the metaphysical complement to Lamarck’s 


KXIV Back to Methuselah 


itural] history, as it dem that the driving force 


hind Evolution is.a_will-to-live, and to live, as ist 
id long before, more abundantly... And the earlier phil- 
ophers, from Plato to Leibnitz, had kept the human 
ind open for the thought of the universe as one idea 


hind all its physically apprehensible transformations. 






orrected Dates for the Discovery of Evolution 


‘All this, remember, is the state of things in the pre- 
arwin period, which so many of us still think of as a 
-e-evolutionary period. Evolutionism was the rage 
fore Queen Victoria came to the throne. To fix this 
ironology, let me repeat the story told by Weismann 
the July revolution in Paris in 1830, when the French 
xt rid of Charles the Tenth. Goethe was then still 
nang; and a French friend of his called on him and 
und him wildly excited: ‘What do you think of the 
reat event?” said Goethe. “The volcano is in erup- 
on; and all is in flames. ‘There can no longer be dis- 
ission with closed doors.” 'The Frerichman replied that 
» doubt it was a terrible business ; but what could they 
‘pect with such a ministry and such aking? “Stuff! 
id Goethe: “I am not thinking of these people at all, 
it of the open rupture in the French Academy between 
uvier and St. Hilaire. It is of the utmost importance 
science.” ‘The rupture Goethe meant was about Evo- 
tion, Cuvier contending that there were four species, 
id St. Hilaire that there was only one. 

From 1830, when Darwin was an apparently unprom- 
ing lad of seventeen, until 1859, when he turned the 
orld upside down by his Origin of Species, there was a 
ump in Evolutionism. The first generation of its 
ithusiasts was ageing and dying out; and their suc- 
ssors were beg taught from the Book of Genesis, 


Back to Methuselah XXXV 


just as Edward VI was (and Edward VII too, for that 
matter). Nobody who knew the theory was adding any- 
thing to it. This slump not only heightened the impres- 
sion of entire novelty when Darwin brought the subject 
to the front again: it probably prevented him from real- 
izing how much. had been done before, even by his own 
grandfather, to whom he was accused of being unjust. 
Besides, he was not really carrying on the family busi- 
ness. He was an entirely original worker; and he was 
on a new tack, as we shall see presently. And he would 
not in any case have thought much, as a practical 
naturalist, of the more or less mystical intellectual specu- 
lations of the Deists of 1790-1830. Scientific workers 
were very tired of Deism just then. They had given up 
the riddle of the Great First Cause as insoluble, and 
were calling themselves, accordingly, Agnostics. They 
had turned from the inscrutable question of Why things 
existed, to the spade work of discovering What was 
really occurring in the world and How it really occurred. 

With all his attention bent in this new direction, 
Darwin soon noticed that a good deal was occurring in 
an entirely unmystical and even unmeaning way of which 
the older speculative Deist-Evolutionists had taken little 
or no account. Nowadays, when we are turning in 
weary disgust and disillusion from Neo-Darwinism and 
Mechanism to Vitalism and Creative Evolution, it is 
difficult to imagine how this new departure of Darwin’s 
could possibly have appealed to his contemporaries as 
exciting, agreeable, above all as hopeful. Let me there- 
fore try to bring back something of the atmosphere of 
that time by describing a scene, very characteristic, of 
its superstitions, in which I took what was then consid- 
ered an unspeakably shocking part.

Defying the Lightning: a Frustrated 
Experiment 


One evening in 1878 or thereabouts, I, being then in 
my earliest twenties, was at a bachelor party of young 
men of the professional class in the house of a doctor 
in the Kensingtonian quarter of London. They fell to 
talking about religious revivals; and an anecdote was 
related of a man who, having incautiously scoffed at 
the mission of Messrs Moody and Sankey, a then famous 
firm of American evangelists, was subsequently carried 
home on a shutter, slain by divine vengeance as a blas- 
phemer. A timid minority, without quite venturing to 
question the truth of the incident—for they naturally 
did not care to run the risk of going home on shutters 
themselves—nevertheless shewed a certain disposition to 
cavil at those who exulted in it; and something ap- 
proaching to an argument began. At last it was alleged 
by the most evangelical of the disputants that Charles 
Bradlaugh, the most formidable atheist on the Secularist 
platform, had taken out his watch publicly and chal- 
lenged the Almighty to strike him dead in five minutes 
if he really existed and disapproved of atheism. The 
leader of the cavillers, with great heat, repudiated this as a 
gross calumny, declaring that Bradlaugh had repeatedly 
and ‘indignantly contradicted it, and implying that the 
atheist champion was far too pious a man to commit such 
a blasphemy. This exquisite confusion of ideas roused 
my sense of comedy. It was clear to me that the chal- 
lenge attributed to Charles Bradlaugh was a scientific 
experiment of a quite simple, straightforward, and 
proper kind to ascertain whether the expression of athe- 
istic opinions really did involve any personal risk. It 
was certainly the method taught in the Bible, Elijah 
having confuted the prophets of Baal in precisely that 


Back to Methuselah XXXVI 


way, with every circumstance of bitter mockery of their 
god when he failed to send down fire from heaven. Ac- 
cordingly I said that if the question at issue were 
whether the penalty of questioning the theology of 
Messrs Moody and Sankey was to be struck dead on the 
spot by an incensed deity, nothing could effect a more 
convincing settlement of it than the very obvious experi- 
ment attributed to Mr Bradlaugh, and that consequently 
if he had not tried it, he ought to have tried it. The 
omission, I added, was one which could easily be reme- 
died there and then, as I happened to share Mr. Brad- 
laugh’s views as to the absurdity of the-belief in these 
violent interferences with the order of nature by a short- 
tempered and thin-skinned supernatural deity. There- 
fore—and at that point I took out my watch. 

The effect was electrical. Neither sceptics nor devo~ 
tees were prepared to abide the result of the experiment. 
In vain did I urge the pious to trust nm the accuracy of 
their deity’s aim with a thunderbolt, and the justice of 
his discrimination between the innocent and the guilty. 
In vain did I appeal to the sceptics to accept the logical 
outcome of their scepticism: it soon appeared that when 
thunderbolts were in question there were no sceptics. 
Our host, seeing that his guests would vanish precipi- 
tately if the impious challenge were uttered, leaving him 
alone with a solitary infidel under sentence of extermina- 
tion in five minutes, interposed and forbade the experi- 
ment, pleading at the same time for a change of subject. 
I of course complied, but could not refrain from remark- 
ing that though the dreadful words had not been uttered, 
yet, as the thought had been formulated in my mind, it 
was very doubtful whether the consequences could be 
averted by sealing my lips. However, the rest appeared 
to feel that the game would be played according to the 
rules, and it mattered very little what I thought so long

In Quest of the First Cause 


Another reminiscence. In those days we thought in 
rms of time and space, of cause and effect, as we still 
»; but we do not now demand from a religion that it 
all explain the universe completely in terms of cause 
1d effect, and present the world to us as a manufac- 
wed article and as the private property of its Manu- 
icturer. We did then. We were invited to pity the 
lusion of certain heathens who held that the world 1s 
tpported by an elephant who is supported by a tortoise. 
[ahomet decided that the mountains are great weights 
' keep the world from being blown away into space. 
ut we refuted these crientals by asking triumphantly 
hat the tortoise stands on? Freethinkers asked which 
ime first: the owl or the egg. Nobody thought of say- 
g that the ultimate problem of existence, being clearly 
soluble and even unthinkable on causation lines, could 
t be a causation problem. To pious people this would 
ave been flat atheism, because they assumed that God 
ust be a Cause, and sometimes called him The Great 
irst Cause, or, in still choicer language, The Primal 
ause. ‘To the Rationalists it would have been a renun- 
ation of reason. Here and there a man would confess 
vat he stood as with a dim lantern in a dense fog, and 
yuld see but a little way in any direction into infinity. 
ut he did not really believe that infinity was infinite or 
iat the eternal was also sempiternal : he assumed that all 
ings, known and unknown, were caused. 

Hence it was that I found myself one day towards 
ie end of the eighteen-seventies in a cell in the old

had been called by one of his flock to attempt my con- 
version to Roman Catholicism. The universe. exists, 
said the father: somebody must have made it. (If that, 
somebody exists, said I, somebody must have made him. ' 
I grant you that for the sake of argument, said the’ 
Jesuit. I grant you a maker of God. I grant you a 
maker of the maker of God. I grant you as long a line 
of makers as you please; but an infinity of makers is 
unthinkable and extravagant: it is no harder to believe 
in number one than in number fifty thousand or fifty 
million; so why not accept number one and stop there, 
since no attempt to get behind him will remove your 
Jogical difficulty? By your leave, said I, it is as easy 
for me to believe that the universe made itself as that 
a maker of the universe made himself; in fact much 
easier; for the universe visibly exists and makes itself 
as it goes along, whereas a maker for it is a hypothesis. 
Of course we could get no further on these lines. He 
‘rose and said that we were like two men working a saw, 
he pushing it forward and I pushing it back, and cutting 
nothing; but when we had dropped the subject and were 
walking through the refectory, he returned to it for a 
moment to say that he should go mad if he lost his belief. 
I, glorying in the robust callousness of youth and the 
comedic spirit, felt quite comfortable and said so; 
though I was touched, too, by his evident sincerity. 
These two anecdotes are superficially trivial and even 
comic; but there is an abyss of horror beneath them. 
They reveal] a condition so utterly irreligious that reli- 
gion means nothing but belief in a nursery bogey, and 
its inadequacy is demonstrated by a toy logical dilemma, 
neither the bogey nor the dilemma having anything to 
do with religion, or being serious enough to impose on 
or confuse any properly educated child over the age of

»jectness of the credulity or the flippancy of the scep- 
cism, ‘The result was inevitable. All who were strong-

hen, objecting to the admission of Charles Bradlaugh 
to parliament, he said “Hang it all, a man should be-

ie bogey into the dust-bin; but none the less the world, 
ir corner of the universe, did not look like a pure acci- 
mt: it presented evidences of design in every direction. 
here was mind and purpose behind it. As the anti- 
radlaugh member would have put it, there must be 
mebody behind the something: ne atheist could get 
rer that. 


Paley’s Watch 


Paley had put the argument in an apparently unan- 
verable form. If you found a watch, full of mechan- 
m exquisitely adapted to produce a series of opera- 
ons all leading to the fulfilment of one central pur- 
se Of measuring for mankind the march of the day 
id night, could you believe that it was not the work 
’ a cunning artificer who had designed and contrived 
all to that end? And here was a far more wonderful 
ung than a watch, a man with all his organs wonder- 
illy contrived, cords and levers, girders and kingposts, 
rculating systems of pipes and valves, dialysing mem- 
canes, chemical] retorts, carburettors, ventilators, inlets 
ad outlets, telephone transmitters in his ears, light re- 
yrders and lenses in his eyes: was it conceivable that 


Back to Methuselah xh 


this was the work of chance? that no artificer had 
wrought here, that there was no purpose in this, no 
design, no guiding intelligence? The thing was incred- 
ible. In vain did Helmholtz declare that “the eye has 
every possible defect that can be found in an optical 
instrument, and even some peculiar to itself,” and that 
“if an optician tried to sell me an instrument which had 
all these defects I should think myself quite justified in 
blaming his carelessness in the strongest terms, and 
sending him back his mstrument.” To discredit the 
optician’s skill was not to get rid of the optician. The 
eye might not be so cleverly made as Paley thought: 
but it was made somehow, by somebody. 

And then my argument with the Jesuit began all over 
again. It was easy enough to say that every man makes 
his own eyes: indeed the embryologists had actually 
caught him doing it. But what about the very evident 
purpose that prompted him to do it? Why did he want 
to see, if not to extend his consciousness and his knowl- 
edge and his power? That purpose was at work every- 
where, and must be something bigger than the individual 
eye-making man. Only the stupidest muckrakers could 
fail to see this, and even to know 1t as part of their own 
consciousness. Yet to admit it seemed to involve letting 
the bogey come back, so inextricably had we managed 
to mix up belief in the bogey’s existence with belief in 
the existence of design in the universe. 


The Irresistible Cry of Order, Order! 


Our scornful young scientific and philosophic lions of 
today must not blame the Church of England for this 
confusion of thought. In 1562 the Church, in convoca- 
tion in London “for the avoiding of diversities of opin- 
ions and for the establishment of consent touching true 


Li Back to Methuselah 


eligion,” proclaimed in their first utterance, and as an 
\rticle of Religion, that God is “without body, parts, or 
Jassions,”? or, as we say, an Elan Vital or Life Force. 
Jnfortunately neither parents, parsons, nor pedagogues 
ould be induced to adopt that article. St. John might 
ay that “God is spirit” as pointedly as he pleased; our 
‘overeion Lady Elizabeth might ratify the Article 
gain and again; serious divines might feel as deeply 
s they could that a God with body, parts, and passions 
ould be nothing but an anthropomorphic idol; no mat- 
er: people at large could not conceive a God who was 
ot anthropomorphic: they stood by the Old Testament 
2gends of a God whose parts had been seen by one of 
he patriarchs, and finally set up as against the Church, 
. God who, far from being without body, parts, or pas- 
ions, was composed of nothing else, and of very evil. 
assions too. They imposed this idol in practice on the 
yhurch itself, in spite of the First Article, and thereby 
omeopathically produced the atheist, whose denial of 
rod was simply a denial of the idol and a demonstration 
gainst an unbearable and most unchristian idolatry. 
“he idol was, as Shelley had been expelled from Oxford 
or pointing out, an almighty fiend, with a pretty char- 
cter and unlimited power, spiteful, cruel, jealous, vin- - 
ictive, and physically violent. The most villainous 
choolmasters, the most tyrannical parents, fell far short 
a their attempts to imitate it. But it was not its social 
ices that brought it low. What made it scientifically 
ntolerable was that it was ready at a moment’s notice to 
(pset the whole order of the universe on the most trum- 
ery provocation, whether by stopping the sun in the 
alley of Ajalon or sending an atheist home dead on a 
hutter (the shutter was indispensable because it marked 
he utter unpreparedness of the atheist, who, unable to 
ave himself by a deathbed repentance, was subsequently 


Back to Methuselah xlili 


roasted through all eternity in blazing brimstone). It 
was this disorderliness, this refusal to obey its own laws 
of nature, that created a scientific need for its destruc- 
tion. Science could stand a cruel and unjust god; for 
nature was full of suffering and injustice. But a dis- 
orderly god was impossible. In the Middle Ages a com- 
promise had been made by which two different orders of 
truth, religious and scientific, had been recognized, in 
order that a school man might say that two and two 
make four without being burnt for heresy. But the 
nineteenth century, steeped in a meddling, presumptuous, 
reading-and-writing, socially and politically powerful 
ignorance inconceivable by Thomas Aquinas or even 
Roger Bacon, was incapable of so convenient an arrange- 
ment; and science was strangled by bigoted ignoramuses 
claming infallibility for their interpretation of the 
Bible, which was regarded, not as a literature nor even 
as a book, but partly as an oracle which answered and 
settled all questions, and partly as a talisman to be car- 
ried by soldiers in their breast pockets or placed under 
the pillows of persons who were afraid of ghosts. The 
tract shops exhibited in their windows bullet-dinted tes- 
taments, mothers’ gifts to their soldier sons whose lives 
had been saved by it; for the muzzle-loaders of those 
days could not drive a projectile through so many pages. 


The Moment and the Man 


This superstition of a continual capricious disorder 
in nature, of a lawgiver who was also a lawbreaker, made 
atheists in all directions among clever and lightminded 
people. But atheism did not account for Paley’s watch. 
Atheism accounted for nothing; and it was the business 
of science to account for everything that was plainly 
accountable. Science had no use for mere negation: 


liv Back to Methuselah 


rhat was desired by it above all things just then was 4 
emonstration that the evidences of design could be ex~ 
lained without resort to the hypothesis of a personal 
esigner. If only some genius, whilst admitting Paley’s 
acts, could knock the brains out of Paley by the dis- 
overy of a method whereby watches could happen with- 
ut watchmakers, that genius was assured of such a wel- 
ome from the thought of his day as no natural philoso- 
her had ever enjoyed before. 

The time being thus ripe, the genius appeared; and 
is name was Charles Darwin. And now, what did Dar- 
rin really discover? 

Here, I am afraid, I shall require once more the assist- 
nce of the giraffe, or, as he was called in the days of 
he celebrated Buffoon, the camelopard (by children, 
ammyleopard). I do not remember how this animal 1m- 
osed himself illustratively on the Evolution contro- 
ersy; but there was no getting away from him then; 
nd I am old-fashioned enough to be unable to get away 
rom him now. How did he come by his long neck? 
samarck would have said, by wanting to get at the ten- 
er leaves high up on the tree, and trying until he 
ucceeded in wishing the necessary length of neck into 
xistence. Another answer was also possible: namely, 
hat some prehistoric stock-breeder, wishing to produce 
_natural curiosity, selected the longest-necked animals 
ie could find, and bred from them until at last an animal 
ith an abnormally long neck was evolved by intentional 
election, just as the race-horse or the fantail pigeon 
as been evolved. Both these explanations, you will ob- 
erve, involve consciousness, will, design, purpose, either 
nm the part of the animal itself or on the part of a supe- 
ior intelligence controlling its destiny. Darwin pointed 
ut—and this and no more was Darwin’s famous dis- 
overy—that a third explanation, involving neither will 


Back to Methuselah xlv 


nor purpose nor design either in the animal or anyone 
else, was on the cards. If your neck is too short to 
reach your food, you die. That may be the simple ex- 
planation of the fact that all the surviving animals that 
feed on foliage have necks or trunks long enough to 
reach it. So bang goes your belief that the necks must 
have been designed to reach the food. But Lamarck did 
not believe that the necks were so designed in the be- 
ginning: he believed that the long necks were evolved 
by wanting and trying. Not necessarily, said Darwin. 
Consider the effect on the giraffes of the natural multi- 
plication of their numbers, as insisted on by Malthus. 
Suppose the average height of the foliage-eating ani- 
mals is four feet, and that they increase in numbers 
until a time comes when all the trees are eaten away to 
within four feet of the ground. Then the animals who 
happen to be an inch or two short of the average will 
die of starvation. All the animals who happen to be an 
inch or so above the average will be better fed and 
stronger than the others. They will secure the strong- 
est and tallest mates; and their progeny will survive 
whilst the average ones and the sub-average ones will 
die out. This process, by which the species gains, say, 
an inch in reach, will repeat itself until the giraffe’s neck 
is so long that he can always find food enough within 
his reach, at which point, of course, the selective process 
stops and the length of the giraffe’s neck stops with it. 
Otherwise, he would grow until he could browse off the 
trees in the moon. And this, mark you, without the in- 
tervention of any stock-breeder, human or divine, and 
without will, purpose, design, or even consciousness be- 
yond the blind will to satisfy hunger. It is true that 
this blind will, being in effect a will to live, gives away 
the whole case; but still, as compared to the open-eyed 
intelligent wanting and trying of Lamarck, the Dar- 


lvi Back to Methuselah 


inian process may be described as a chapter of acci- 
ants. As such, it seems simple, because you do not at 
rst realize all that it involves. But when its whole sig- 
ificance dawns on you, your heart sinks into a heap of 
ind within you. There is a hideous fatalism about 1t, 
ghastly and damnable reduction of beauty and intelli- 
ence, of strength and purpose, of honor and aspiration, 
» such casually picturesque changes as an avalanche 
ay make in landscape, or a railway accident in a human 
gure. To call this Natural Selection is a blasphemy, 
ossible to many for whom Nature is nothing but a 
sual aggregation of inert and dead matter, but eter- 
ally impossible to the spirits and souls of the righteous. 
"it be no blasphemy, but a truth of science, then the 
‘ars of heaven, the showers and dew, the winter and 
immer, the fire and heat, the mountains and hills, may 
» longer be called to exalt the Lord with us by praise: 
1eir work is to modify all things by blindly starving 
id murdering everything that is not lucky enough to 
irvive in the universal struggle for hogwash. 


The Brink of the Bottomless Pit 


Thus did the neck of the giraffe reach out across the 
hole heavens and make men believe that what they saw 
ere was a gloaming of the gods. For if this sort of 
lection could turn an antelope into a giraffe, it could 
meceivably turn a pond full of amebas into the French 
cademy. Though Lamarck’s way, the way of life, will, 
spiration, and achievement, remained still possible, this 
2wly shewn way of hunger, death, stupidity, delusion, 
ance, and bare survival was also possible: was indeed 
ost certainly the way in which many apparently intel- 
gently designed transformations had actually come to 
ass. Had I not preluded with the apparently idle 


Back to Methuselah xl vil 


story of my revival of the controversial methods of 
Elijah, I should be asked how it was that the explorer 
who opened up this gulf of despair, far from being stoned 
or crucified as the destroyer of the honor of the race and 
the purpose of the world, was hailed as Deliverer, Savior, 
Prophet, Redeemer, Enlightener, Rescuer, Hope Giver, 
and Epoch Maker; whilst poor Lamarck was swept aside 
as a crude and exploded guesser hardly worthy to be 
named as his erroneous forerunner. In the light of my 
anecdote, the explanation is obvious. The first thing 
the gulf did was to swallow up Paley, and the Disorderly 
Designer, and Shelley’s Almighty Fiend, and all the rest 
of the pseduo-religious rubbish that had blocked every 
upward and onward path since the hopes of men had 
turned to Science as their true Savior.. It seemed such 
a convenient grave that nobody at first noticed that it 
was nothing less than the bottomless pit, now become a 
very real terror. For though Darwin left a path round 
it for his soul, his followers presently dug it right across 
the whole width of the way. Yet for the moment, there 
was nothing but wild rejoicing: a sort of scientific maf- 
ficking. We had been so oppressed by the notion that 
everything that happened in the world was the arbitrary 
personal act of an arbitrary personal god of danger- 
ously jealous and cruel personal character, so that even 
the relief of the pains of childbed and the operating 
table by chloroform was objected to as an interference 
with his arrangements which he would probably resent, 
that we just jumped at Darwin. When Napoleon was 
asked what would happen when he died, he said that 
Europe would express its intense relief with a great 
“Ouf!? Well, when Darwin killed the god who objected 
to chloroform, everybody who had ever thought about it 
said “Ouf!? Paley was buried fathoms deep with his 
watch, now fully accounted for without any divine arti-

cer at all. We were so glad to be rid of both that we 
ever gave a thought to the consequences. When a 
\risoner sees the door of his dungeon open, he dashes 
or it without stopping to think where he shall get his 
inner outside. The moment we found that we could do 
rithout Shelley’s almighty fiend intellectually, he went 
ato the gulf that seemed only a dustbin with a sudden- 
ess that made our own lives one of the most astonishing 
eriods in history. If I had told that uncle of mine that 
rithin thirty years from the date of our conversation 
should be exposing myself to suspicions of the grossest 
uperstition by questioning the sufficiency of Darwin; 
1aintaining the reality of the Holy Ghost; and declar- 
ag that the phenomenon of the Word becoming Flesh 
ras occurring daily, he would have regarded me as the 
10st extravagant madman our family had ever pro- 
luced. Yet it was so. Iu 1906 I might have vituper- 
ted Jehovah more heartily than ever Shelley did without 
liciting a protest in any circle of thinkers, or shocking 
ny public audience accustomed to modern discussion; 
ut when I described Darwin as “an intelligent and in- 
ustrious pigeon fancier,” that blasphemous levity, as it 
eemed, was received with horror and indignation. The 
ide has now turned; and every puny whipster may say 
that he likes about Darwin; but anyone who wants to 
now what it was to be a Lamarckian during the last 
uarter of the nineteenth century has only to read Mr. 
‘esting Jones’s memoir of Samuel Butler to learn how 
ompletely even a man of genius could isolate himself by 
mtagonizing Darwin on the one hand and the Church 
n the other. 


Why Darwin Converted the Crowd 
I am well aware that in describing the effect of Dar- 
rin’s discovery on naturalists and on persons capable of 


Back to Methuselah xlix 


serious reflection on the nature and attributes of God, I 
am leaving the vast mass of the British public out of 
account. I have pointed out elsewhere that the British 
nation does not consist of atheists and Plymouth Broth- 
ers; and I am not now going to pretend that it ever 
consisted of Darwinians and Lamarckians. The average 
citizen is irreligious and unscientific: you talk to him 
about cricket and golf, market prices and party politics, 
not about evolution and relativity, transubstantiation 
and predestination. Nothing will knock into his head 
the fateful distinction between Evolution as promul-_ 
gated by Erasmus Darwin, and Circumstantial (so- 
called-Natural) Selection as_xrevealed by his grandson. 
Yet the doctrine of Charles reached him, though the 
doctrine of Erasmus had passed over his head. Why 
did not Erasmus Darwin popularize the word Evolution 
as effectively as Charles? | 

The reason was, I think, that Circumstantial Selection 
is easier to understand, more visible and concrete, than 
Lamarckian evolution. Evolution as a philosophy and 
physiology of the will is a mystical process, which can 
be apprehended only by a trained, apt, and compre- 
hensive thinker. Though the phenomena of use and 
disuse, of wanting and trying, of the manufacture of 
weight lifters and wrestlers from men of ordinary 
strength, are familiar enough as facts, they are ex- 
tremely puzzling as subjects of thought, and lead you 
into metaphysics the moment you try to account for 
them. But pigeon fanciers, dog fanciers, gardeners, 
stock breeders, or stud grooms, can understand Circum- 
stantial Selection, because it is their business to produce 
transformation by imposing on flowers and animals a 
Selection From Without. All that Darwin had to say 
to them was that the mere chapter ‘of accidents is 
always doing on a huge scale what they themselves are 


Back to Methuselah 


ying on a very small scale. ‘There is hardly a laborer 
tached to an English country house who has not taken 
litter of kittens or puppies to the bucket, and drowned 
1 of them except the one he thinks the most promising. 
ach a man has nothing to learn about the survival of 
ie fittest except that it acts in more ways than he has 
1t noticed; for he knows quite well, as you will find if 
yn are not too proud to talk to him, that this sort of 
lection occurs naturally (in Darwin’s sense) too: that, 
w instance, a hard winter will kill off a weakly child as 
ie bucket kills off a weakly puppy. ‘Then there is the 
irm laborer. Shakespear’s Touchstone, a court-bred 
iol, was shocked to find in the shepherd a natural 
hilosopher, and opined that he would be damned for 
1e part he took in the sexual selection of sheep. As to 
1e production of new species by the selection of vari- 
tions, that is no news to your gardener. Now if you 
re familiar with these three processes: the survival of 
ie fittest, sexual selection, and variation leading to 
ow kinds, there is nothing to puzzle you in Darwinism. 
That was the secret of Darwim’s popularity. He 
ever puzzled anybody. If very few of us have read 
‘he Orgin of Species from end to end, it is not because 
, overtaxes our mind, but because we take in the whole 
ase and are prepared to accept it long before we have 
ome to the end of the innumerable instances and illus- 
rations of which the book mainly consists. Darwin 
ecomes tedious in the manner of a man who insists on 
ontinuing to prove his imnocence after he has been 
cquitted. You assure him that there is not a stain on 
is character, and beg him to leave the court; but he 
ill not be content with enough evidence: he will have 
ou listen to all the evidence that exists in the world. 
Jarwin’s industry was enormous. His patience, his 
erseverance, his conscientiousness reached the human 


Back to Methuselah li 


limit. But he never got deeper beneath or higher above 
his facts than an ordinary man could follow him. He 
was not conscious of ‘having raised a stupendous issue, 
because, though it arose instantly, it was not his busi- 
ness. He was conscious of having discovered a process 
of transformation and modification which accounted for 
a great deal of natural history. But he did not put it 
forward as accounting for the whole of natural history. 
He included it under the heading of Evolution, though 
it was only pseudo-evolution at best; but he revealed it 
as a method of evolution, not as the method of evolution. 
He did not pretend that it excluded other methods, or 
that it was the chief method. Though he demonstrated 
that many transformations which had been taken as 
functional adaptations (the current phrase for 
Lamarckian evolution) either certainly were or conceiv- 
ably might be due to Circumstantial Selection, he was 
careful not to claim that he had superseded Lamarck or 
disproved Functional Adaptation. In short, he was not 
a Darwinian, but an honest naturalist working away at 
his job with so little preoccupation with theological] 
speculation that he never quarelled with the small evan- 
gelical sect into which he was born, and remained to the 
end the engagingly simple and socially easygoing soul 
he had been in his boyhood, when his elders doubted 


whether he would ever be of much use in the world. 


How We Rushed Down a Steep Place 


Not so the rest of us intellectuals. We all began 
going to the devil with the utmost cheerfulness. Every 
one who had a mind to change, changed it. Only Samuel 
Butler, on whom Darwin had acted homeopathically, 
reacted against him furiously; ran up the Lamarckian 
flag to the top-gallant peak; declared with penetrating 


li Back to Methuselah 


accuracy that Darwin had “banished mind from the uni- 
verse”; and even attacked Darwin’s personal character, 
unable to bear the fact that the author of so abhorrent 
a doctrine was an amiable and upright man. Nobody 
would listen to him. He was so completely submerged 
by the flowing tide of Darwinism that when Darwin 
wanted to clear up the misunderstanding on which Butler 
was basing his personal attacks, Darwin’s friends, very 
foolishly and snobbishly, persuaded him that Butler was 
too ill-conditioned and negligible to be answered. That 
they could not recognize in Butler a man of genius mat- 
tered little: what did matter was that they could not 
understand the provocation under which he was raging. 
They actually regarded the banishment of mind from 
the universe as a glorious enlightenment and emancipa- 
tion for which he was ignorantly ungrateful. Even now, 
when Butler’s eminence is unchallenged, and his bi- 
ographer, Mr. Festing Jones, is enjoying a vogue like 
that of Boswell or Lockhart, +is memoirs shew him 
rather as a shocking example of the bad controversial 
manners of our country parsonages than as a prophet 
who tried to head us back when we were gaily dancing 
to our damnation across the rainbow bridge which Dar- 
winism had thrown over the gulf which separates life 
and hope from death and despair. We were intellect- 
ually intoxicated with the idea that the world could 
make itself without design, purpose, skill, or intelli- 
gence: in short, without life. We completely overlooked 
the difference between the modification of species by 
adaptation to their environment and the appearance of 
new species: we just threw in the word “‘variations” or 
the word “sports” (fancy a man of science talking of an 
unknown factor as a sport instead of as x!) and left 
them to “accumulate” and account for the difference 
between a cockatoo and a hippopotamus. Such phrases 


Back to Methuselah liii 


set us free to revel in demonstrating to the Vitalists and 
Bible worshippers that if we once admit the existence 
of any kind of force, however unintelligent, and stretch 
out the past toe unlimited time for such force to operate 
accidentally in, that force may conceivably, by the action 
of Circumstantial Selection, produce a world in which 
every function has an organ perfectly adapted to per- 
form it, and therefore presents every appearance of 
having been designed, like Paley’s watch, by a conscious 
and intelligent artificer for the purpose. We took a 
perverse pleasure in arguing, without the least suspicion 
that we were reducing ourselves to absurdity, that all 
the books in the British Museum library might have been 
written word for word as they stand on the shelves if no 
human being had ever been conscious, just as the trees 
stand in the forest doing wonderful things without 
consciousness. 

And the Darwinians went far beyond denying con- 
sciousness to trees. Weismann insisted that the chick 
breaks out of its eggshell automatically; that the but- 
terfly, springing into the air to avoid the pounce of the 
lizard, “does not wish to avoid death; knows nothing 
about death,” what has happened being simply that a 
flight instinct evolved by Circumstantial Selection reacts 
promptly to a visual impression produced by the lizard’s 
movement. His proof is that the butterfly immediately 
settles again on the flower, and repeats the performance 
every time the lizard springs, thus shewing that it learns 
nothing from experience, and—Weismann concludes— 
is not conscious of what it does. 

It should hardly have escaped so curious an observer 
that when the cat jumps up on the dinner table, and you 
put it down, it instantly jumps up again, and finally 
establishes its right to a place on the cloth by convincing 
you that if you put it down a hundred times it will jump 


liv Back to Methuselah 


up a hundred and one times; so that if you desire its 
company at dinner you can have it only on its own terms. 
If Weismann really thought that cats act thus without 
any consciousness or any purpose, immediate or ulterior, 
he must have known very little about cats. But a 
thoroughgoing Weismannite, if any such still survive 
from those mad days, would contend that I am not at 
present necessarily conscious of what I am doing; that 
my writing of these lines, and your reading of them, 
are effects of Circumstantial Selection; that I need know 
no more about Darwinism than a butterfly knows of a 
lizard’s appetite; and that the proof that I actually am 
doing it unconsciously is that as I have spent forty 
years in writing in this fashion without, as far as I can 
see, producing any visible effect on public opinion, I 
must be incapable of learning from experience, and am 
therefore a mere automaton. And the Weismannite 
demonstration of this would of course be an equally 
unconscious effect of Circumstantial Selection. 


Darwinism Not Finally Refutable 


Do not too hastily say that this is inconceivable. To 
Circumstantial Selection all mechanical and chemical 
reactions are possible, provided you accept the geolo- 
gists’ estimates of the great age of the earth, and there- 
fore allow time enough for the circumstances to operate. 
It is true that mere survival of the fittest in the struggle 
for existence plus sexual selection fail as hopelessly to 
account for Darwin’s own life work as for my conquest 
of the bicycle; but who can prove that there are not 
other soulless factors, unnoticed or undiscovered, which 
only require imagination enough to fit them to the evo- 
lution of an automatic Jesus or Shakespear? When a 
man tells you that you are a product of Circumstantial 


Back to Methuselah lv 


Selection solely, you cannot finally disprove it. You 
can only tell him out of the depths of your inner con- 
viction that he is a fool and a liar. But as this, though 
British, is uncivil, it is wiser to offer him the counter- 
assurance that you are the product of Lamarckian 
evolution, formerly called Functional Adaptation and 
new Creative Evolution, and challenge him to disprove 
that, which he can no more do than you can disprove 
Circumstantial Selection, both forces being conceivably 
able to produce anything if you only give them rope 
enough. You may also defy him to act for a single 
hour on the assumption that he may safely cross Oxford 
Street in a state of unconsciousness, trusting to his 
dodging reflexes to react automatically and promptly 
enough to the visual impression produced by a motor 
bus, and the audible impression produced by its hooter. 
But if you allow yourself to defy him to explain any 
particular action of yours by Circumstantial Selection, 
he should always be able to find some explanation that 
will fit the case if only he is ingenious enough and goes 
far enough to find it. Darwin found several such ex- 
planations in his controversies. Anybody who really 
wants to believe that the universe has been produced by 
Circumstantial Selection co-operating with a force as 
inhuman as we conceive magnetism to be can find a 
logical] excuse for his belief if he tries hard enough. 


Three Blind Mice 


The stultification and damnation which ensued are 
illustrated by a comparison of the ease and certainty 
with which Butler’s mind moved to humane and inspir- 
ing conclusions with the grotesque stupidities and 
cruelties of the idle and silly controversy which arose 
among the Darwinians as to whether acquired habits 


vi Back to Methuselah 


an be transmitted from parents tc offspring. Consider, 
or example, how Weismann set to work on that subject. 
in Evolutionist with a live mind would first have 
ropped the popular expression “acquired habits,” be- 
ause to an Evolutionist there are no other habits and 
an be no others, a man being only an ameba with 
cquirements. He would then have considered carefully 
he process by which he himself had acquired his habits. 
fe would have assumed that the habits with which he 
‘as born must have been acquired by a similar process. 
fe would have known what a habit is: that is, an action 
dluntarily attempted until it has become more or less 
utomatic and involuntary; and it would never have 
ecurred to him that injuries or accidents coming from 
sternal sources against the will of the victim could pos- 
ibly establish a habit: that, for instance, a family could 
equire a habit of being killed in railway accidents. 
And yet Weismann began to investigate the point by 
shaving like the butcher’s wife in the old catch. He 
ot a colony of mice, and cut off their tails. Then he 
aited to see whether their children would be born with- 
at tails. They were not, as Butler could have told him 
eforehand. He then cut off the children’s tails, and 
aited to see whether the grandchildren would be born 
ith at least rather short tails. They were not, as I 
suld have told him beforehand. So with the patience 
od industry on which men of science pride themselves, 
e cut off the grandchildren’s tails too, and waited, full 
f hope, for the birth of curtailed great-grandchildren. 
ut their tails were quite up to the mark, as any fool 
suld have told him beforehand. Weismann then 
ravely drew the inference that acquired habits cannot 
2 transmitted. And yet Weismann was not a born 
nbecile. He was an exceptionally clever and studious - 
ian, not without roots of imagination and philosophy in 


Back to Methuselah lvil 


him which Darwinism killed as weeds. How was it that 
he did not see that he was not experimenting with habits 
or characteristics at all? How had he overlooked the 
glaring fact that his experiment had been tried for many 
generations in China on the feet of Chinese women with- 
out producing the smallest tendency on their part to be 
born with abnormally small feet? He must have known 
about the bound feet even if he knew nothing of the 
mutilations, the clipped ears and docked tails, practised 
by dog fanciers and horse breeders on many generations 
of the unfortunate animals they deal in. Such amazing 
blindness and stupidity on the part of a man who was 
naturally neither blind nor stupid is a telling illustration 
of what Darwin unintentionally did to the minds of his 
disciples by turning their attention so exclusively 
towards the part played in Evolution by accident and 
violence operating with entire callousness to suffering 
and sentiment, 

A vital conception of Evolution would have taught 
Weismann that biological problems are not to be solved 
by assaults on mice. The scientific form of his experi- 
ment would have been something like this. Furst, he 
should have procured a colony of mice highly susceptible 
to hypnotic suggestion. He should then have hypnotized 
them into an urgent conviction that the fate of the 
musque world depended on the disappearance of its tail, 
just as some ancient and forgotten experimenter seems 
to have convinced the cats of the Isle of Man. Having 
thus made the mice desire to lose their tails with a life- 
or-death intensity, he would very soon have seen a few 
mice born with little or no tail. ‘These would be recog- 
nized by the other mice as superior beings, and privi- 
leged in the division of food and in sexual selection. 
Ultimately the tailed mice would be put to death as 


Vill Back to Methuselah 


aonsters by their fellows, and the miracle of the tailless 
aouse completely achieved. 

The objection to this experiment is not that it seems 
oo funny to be taken seriously, and is not cruel enough 
o overawe the mob, but simply that it is impossible 
cause the human experimenter cannot get at the 
nouse’s mind. And that is what is wrong with all the 
arren cruelties of the laboratories. Darwin’s followers 
lid not think of this. Their only idea of investigation 
vas to imitate “Nature” by perpetrating violent and 
enseless cruelties, and watch the effect of them with a 
varalyzing fatalism which forbade the smallest effort to 
ise their minds instead of their knives and eyes, and 
stablished an abominable tradition that the man who 
iesitates to be as cruel as Circumstantial Selection itself 
s a traitor to science. For Weismann’s experiment 
tpon the mice was a mere joke compared to the atrocities 
‘committed by other Darwinians in their attempts to 
yrove that mutilations cou:d not be transmitted. No 
loubt the worst of these experiments were not really 
xperiments at all, but cruelties committed by cruel men 
vho were attracted to the laboratory by the fact that it 
vas a secret refuge left by law and public superstition 
‘or the amateur of passionate terture. But there is no 
‘eason to suspect Weismann of Sadism. Cutting off the 
‘ails of several generations of mice is not voluptuous 
mough to tempt a scientific Nero. It was a mere piece 
»f one-eyedness ; and it was Darwin who put out Weis- 
nann’s humane and sensible eye. He blinded many 
wnother eye and paralyzed many another will also. Ever 
since he set up Circumstantial Selection as the creator 
ind ruler of the universe, the scientific world has been 
the very citadel of stupidity and cruelty. Fearful as 
che tribal god of the Hebrews was, nobody ever shud- 
lered as they passed even his meanest and narrowest 


Back to Methuselah lix 


Little Bethel or his proudest war-consecrating cathedral 
1s we shudder now when we pass a physiological labora- 
‘ory. If we dreaded and mistrusted the priest, we could 
it least keep him out of the house; but what of the 
nodern Darwinist surgeon whom we dread and mistrust 
ten times more, but into whose hands we must all give 
surselves from time to time? Miserably as religion had 
seen debased, it did at least still proclaim that our rela- 
tion to one another was that of a fellowship in which we 
were all equal and members one of another before the judg- 
ment-seat of our common father. Darwinism proclaimed 
that our true relation 1s that of competitors and com- 
batants in a struggle for mere survival, and that every 
act of pity or loyalty to the old fellowship is a vain and 
mischievous attempt to lessen the severity of the 
struggle and preserve inferior varieties from the efforts 
of Nature to weed them out. Even in Socialist Societies 
which existed solely to substitute the law of fellowship 
for the law of competition, and the method of providence 
and wisdom for the method of rushing violently down a 
steep place into the sea, I found myself regarded as a 
blasphemer and an ignorant sentimentalist because when- 
ever the Neo-Darwinian doctrine was preached there I 
made no attempt to conceal my intellectual contempt for 
its blind coarseness and shallow logic, or my natural 
abhorrence of its sickening inhumanity. 


The Greatest of These is Self-Control 


As there is no place in Darwinism for free will, or any 
other sort of will, the Neo-Darwinists held that there is 
no such thing as self-control. Yet self-control is just 
the one quality of survival value which Circumstantial 
Selection must invariably and inevitably develop in the 
long run. Uncontrolled qualities may be selected for 


, Back to Methuselah 


ival and development for certain periods and under 
1in circumstances. For instance, since it is the un- 
rnable gluttons who strive the hardest to get food 
drink, their efforts would develop their strength and 
ling in a period of such scarcity that the utmost 
could do would not enable them to over-eat them- 
ss. But a change of circumstances involving a 
tiful supply of food would destroy them. We see 
very thing happening often enough in the case of 
healthy and vigorous poor man who becomes a mil- 
lire by one of the accidents of our competitive com- 
‘e, and immediately proceeds to dig his grave with 
eeth. But the self-controlled man survives all such 
ges of circumstance, because he adapts himself to 
tj and eats neither as much as he can hold nor as 
as he can scrape along on, but as much as is good 
him. What és self-control? It is nothing but a 
ly developed vital sense, dominating and regulating 
mere appetites. To overlook the very existence of 
supreme sense; to miss the obvious inference that it 
e quality that distinguishes the fittest to survive; 
mit, in short, the highest moral claim of Evolu- 
wy Selection: al] this, which the Neo-Darwinians did 
he name of Natural Selection, shewed the most 
ble want of mastery of their own subject, the dull- 
ack of observation of the forces upon which Natural 
‘tion works, 


\ Sample of Lamarcko-Shavian Invective 


he Vitalist philosophers made no such mistakes. 
«sche, for example, thinking out the great central 
1 of the Will to Power instead of cutting off mouse- 
, had no difficulty in concluding that the final ob- 
ve of this Will was power over self, and that the 


Back to Methuselah Lxi 


seekers after power over others and material possessions 
were on a false scent. 

The stultification naturally became much worse as the 
first Darwinians died out. ‘The prestige of these 
pioneers, who had the older evolutionary culture to build 
on, and were in fact no more Darwinian in the modern 
sense than Darwin himself, ceased to dazzle us when 
Huxley and Tyndall and Spencer and Darwin passed 
away, and we were left with the smaller people who began 
with Darwin and took in nothing else. Accordingly, I 
find that in the year 1906 I indulged my temper by 
hurling invectives at the Neo-Darwinians in the follow- 
ing terms. 

“TI really do not wish to be abusive; but when I think 
of these poor little dullards, with their precarious hold 
of just that corner of evolution that a blackbeetle can 
understand—with their retinue of twopenny-halfpenny 
Torquemadas wallowing in the infamies of the vivi- 
sector’s laboratory, and solemnly offering us as epoch- 
making discoveries their demonstrations that dogs get 
weaker and die if you give them no food; that mtense 
pain makes mice sweat; and that if you cut off a dog’s 
leg the three-legged dog will have a four-legged puppy, 
I ask myself what spell has fallen on intelligent and 
humane men that they allow themselves to be imposed 
on by this rabble of dolts, blackguards, imposters, 
quacks, liars, and, worst of all, credulous conscientious 
fools. Better a thousand times Moses and Spurgeon [a 
then famous preacher] back again. After all, you can- 
not understand Moses without imagination nor Spur- 
geon without metaphysics; but you can be a thorough- 
going Neo-Darwinian without imagination, metaphysics, 
poetry, conscience, or decency. For ‘Natural Selection’ 
has no moral significance: it deals with that part of 
evolution which has no purpose, no intelligence, and 


[xii Back to Methuselah 


might more appropriately be called accidental selection, 
or better still, Unnatural Selection, since nothing 1s 
more unnatural than an accident. If it could be proved 
that the whole universe had been produced by such 
Selection, only fools and rascals could bear to live.” 


The Humanitarians and the Problem of Evil 


Yet the humanitarians were as delighted as anybody 
with Darwinism at first. ‘They had been perplexed by 
the Problem of Evil and the Cruelty of Nature. They 
were Shelleyans, but not atheists. ‘Those who believed 
in God were at a terrible disadvantage with the atheist. 
They could not deny the existence of natural facts so 
cruel that to attribute them to the will of God is to make 
God a demon. Belief in God was impossible to any 
thoughtful person without belief in the Devil as well. 
The painted Devil, with his horns, his barbed tail, and 
his abode of burning brimstone, was an incredible bogey ; 
but the evil attributed to him was real enough; and the 
atheists argued that the author of evil, if he exists, must 
be strong enough to overcome God, else God is morally 
responsible for everything he permits the Devil to do. 
Neither conclusion delivered us from the horror of 
attributing the cruelty of nature to the workings of an 
evil will, or could reconcile it with our impulses towards 
justice, mercy, and a higher life. 

A complete deliverance was offered by the discovery 
of Circumstantial Selection: that is to say, of a method 
by which horrors having every appearance of being 
elaborately planned by some intelligent contriver are 
only accidents without any moral significance at all. 
Suppose a watcher from the stars saw a frightful acci- 
dent produced by two crowded trains at full speed 
crashing into one another! How could he conceive that 


Back to Methuselah Lxiil 


a catastrophe brought about by such elaborate ma- 
chinery, such ingenious preparation, such skilled direc- 
tion, such vigilant industry, was quite unintentional? 
Would he not conclude that the signal-men were devils? 

Well, Circumstantial Selection is largely a theory of 
collisions: that is, a theory of the innocence of much 
apparently designed devilry. In this way Darwin 
brought intense relief as well as an enlarged knowledge 
of facts to the humanitarians. He destroyed the 
omnipotence of God for them; but he also exonerated 
God from a hideous charge of cruelty. Granted that 
the comfort was shallow, and that deeper reflection was 
bound to shew that worse than all conceivable devil- 
deities is a blind, deaf, dumb, heartless, senseless mob of 
forces that strike as a tree does when it is blown down 
by the wind, or as the tree itself is struck by lightning. 
That did not occur to the humanitarians at the moment: 
people do not reflect deeply when they are in the first 
happiness of escape from an intolerably oppressive 
situation. Like Bunyan’s pilgrim they could not see 
the wicket gate, nor the Slough of Despond, nor the 
castle of Giant Despair; but they saw the shining light 
at the end of the path, and so started gaily towards it as 
Evolutionists. 

And they were right; for the problem of evil yields 
very easily to Creative Evolution. .If the driving power 
behind Evolution is omnipotent only in the sense that 
there seems no limit to its final achievement; and if it 
must meanwhile struggle with matter and circumstance 
by the method of trial and error, then the world must be 
full of its unsuccessful experiments. Christ may meet 
a tiger, or a High Priest arm-in-arm with a Roman 
Governor, and be the unfittest to survive under the cir- 
cumstances. Mozart may have a genius that prevails 
against Emperors and Archbishops, and a lung that 


lxiv Back to Methuselah 


succumbs to some obscure and noxious property of foul 
air. If all our calamities are either accidents or sincerely 
repented mistakes, there is no malice in the Cruelty of 
Nature and no’ Problem of Evil in the Victorian sense 
at all. The theology of the women who told us that they 
became atheists when they sat by the cradles of their 
children and saw them strangled by the hand of God is 
succeeded by the theology of Blanco Posnet, with his 
“Tt was early days when He made the croup, I guess. 
It was the best He could think of then; but when it 
turned out wrong on His hands He made you and me 
to fight the Croup for Him.” 


How One Touch of Darwin Makes the 
Whole World Kin 


Another humanitarian interest in Darwinism was that 
Darwin popularized Evolution generally, as well as 
making his own special contribution to it. Now the 
general conception of Evolution provides the humani- 
tarian with a scientific basis, because it establishes the 
fundamental equality of all living things. It makes the 
killing of an animal murder in exactly the same sense 
as the killing of a man is murder. It is sometimes neces- 
sary to kill men as it is always necessary to kill tigers; 
but the old theoretic distinction between the two acts has 
been obliterated by Evolution. When J was a child and 
was told that our dog and our parrot, with whom I was 
on intimate terms, were not creatures like myself, but 
were brutal whilst I was reasonable, I not only did not 
believe it, but quite consciously and intellectually formed 
the opinion that the distinction was false; so that after- 
wards, when Darwin’s views were first unfolded to me, I 
promptly said that I had found out all that for myself 
before I was ten years old; and I am far from sure that 


Back to Methuselah Ixv 


my youthful arrogance was not justified; for this sense 
of the kinship of all forms of life is all that is needed to 
make Evolution not only a conceivable theory, but an 
Inspiring one. St. Anthony was ripe for the Evolution 
theory when he preached to the fishes, and St. Francis 
when he called the birds his little brothers. Our vanity, 
and our snobbish conception of Godhead as being, like 
earthly kingship, a supreme class distinction instead of 
the rock on which Equality is built, had led us to insist 
on God offering us special terms by placing us apart 
from and above all the rest of his creatures. Evolution 
took that conceit out of us; and now, though we may 
kill a flea without the smallest remorse, we at all events 
know that we are killing our cousin. No doubt it shocks 
the flea when the creature that an almighty Celestia] 
Flea created expressly for the food of fleas, destroys the 
jumping lord of creation with his sharp and enormous 
thumbnail; but no flea will ever be so foolish as to preach 
that in slaying fleas Man is applying a method of 
Natural Selection which will finally evolve a flea so swift 
that no man can catch him, and so hardy of constitution 
that Insect Powder will have no more effect on him than 
strychnine on an elephant. 


Why Darwin Pleased the Socialists 


The Humanitarians were not alone among the agi- 
tators in their welcome to Darwin. He had the luck to 
please everybody who had an axe to grind. The mili- 
tarists were as enthusiastic as the Humanitarians, the 
Socialists as the Capitalists. The Socialists were 
specially encouraged by Darwin’s insistence on the influ- 
ence of environment. Perhaps the strongest moral 
bulwark of Capitalism is the belief in the efficacy of 
individual righteousness. Robert Owen made desperate 


l Back to Methuselah 


rts to convince England that her criminals, her 
akards, her ignorant and stupid masses, were the 
ims of circumstance: that if we would only establish 
new moral world we should find that the masses born 
an educated and moralized community would be 
aselves educated and moralized. The stock reply to 
is to be found in Lewes’s Life of Goethe. Lewes 
ned the notion that circumstances govern character. 
pointed to the variety of character in the governing 
class to prove the contrary. Similarity of circum- 
ce can hardly be carried to a more desolating dead 
than in the case of the individuals who are born and 
in English country houses, and sent first to Eton 
[arrow, and then to Oxford or Cambridge, to have 
- minds and habits formed. Such a routine would 
roy individuality if anything could. Yet individ- 
come out from it as different as Pitt from Fox, as 
1 Russell from Lord Curzon, as Mr. Winston 
rchill from Lord Robert Cecil. This acceptance of 
congenital character of the individual as the deter- 
ng factor in his destiny had been reinforced by the 
arckian view of Evolution. If the giraffe can 
lop his neck by wanting and trying, a man can 
lop his character in the same way. The old saying, 
ere there is a will, there is a way,’ condenses 
arck’s theory of functional adaptation into a 
erb, This felt bracingly moral to strong minds, 
reassuringly pious to feeble ones. There was no 
: effective retort to the Socialist than to tell him to 
‘m himself before he pretends to reform society. If 
were rich, how pleasant it was to feel that you owed 
‘riches to the superiority of your own character! 
industrial revolution had turned numbers of greedy 
rds into monstrously rich men. Nothing could be 

humiliating and threatening to them than the 


Back to Methuselah \xvil 


view that the falling of a shower of goid into their 
pockets was as pure an accident of our industrial 
system as the falling of a shower of hail on their 
umbrellas. Nothing could be more flattering and forti- 
fying to them than the assumption that they were rich 
because they were virtuous. 

Now Darwinism made a clean sweep of all such self- 
righteousness. It more than justified Robert Owen by 
discovering in the environment of an organism an influ- 
ence on it more patent than Owen had ever claimed. It 
implied that street arabs are produced by slums and not 
by original sin: that prostitutes are produced by starva- 
tion wages and not by feminine concupiscence. It threw 
the authority of science on the side of the Socialist who 
said that he who would reform himself must first reform 
society. It suggested that if we want healthy and 
wealthy citizens we must have healthy and wealthy 
towns; and that these can exist only in healthy and 
wealthy countries. It could be led to the conclusion 
that the type of character which remains indifferent to 
the welfare of its neighbors as long as its own personal 
appetite is satisfied is the disastrous type, and the type 
which is deeply concerned about its environment the only 
possible type for a permanently prosperous community. 
It shewed that the surprising changes which Robert 
Owen had produced in factory children by a change in 
their circumstances which does not seem any too gen- 
erous to us nowadays, were as nothing to the changes— 
changes not only of habits but of species, not only of 
species but of orders—which might conceivably be the 
work of environment acting on individuals without any 
character or intellectual consciousness whatever. No 
wonder the Socialists received Darwin with open arms. 


Vill Back to Methuselah 


Darwin and Karl Marx 


Besides, the Socialists had an evolutionary prophet of 
eir own, who had discredited Manchester as Darwin 
scredited the Garden of Eden. Karl Marx had pro- 
med in his Communist Manifesto of 1848 (now 
joying Scriptural authority in Russia) that civiliza- 
m is an organism evolving irresistibly by circum- 
antial selection; and he published the first volume of 
; Das Kapital in 1867. The revolt against anthropo- 
phic idolatry, which was, as we have seen, the secret 
Darwin’s success, had been accompanied by a revolt 
ainst the conventional respectability which covered 
t only the brigandage and piracy of the feudal barons, 
t the hypocrisy, inhumanity, snobbery, and greed of 
> bourgeoisie, who were utterly corrupted by an 
sentially diabolical identification of success in life with 
x profits. The moment Marx shewed that the relation 
the bourgeoisie to society was grossly immoral and 
astrous, and that the whited wall of starched shirt 
mts concealed and defended the most infamous of all 
rannies and the basest of all robberies, he became an 
ipired prophet in the mind of every generous soul 
om his book reached. He had said and proved what 
2y wanted to have proved; and they would hear 
thing against him. Now Marx was by no means 
‘allible: his economics, half borrowed, and half home- 
\de by a literary amateur, were not, when strictly fol- 
ved up, even favorable to Socialism. His theory of 
ilization had been promulgated already in Buckle’s 
story of Civilization, a book as epoch-making in the 
nds of its readers as Das Kapital. There was nothing 
out Socialism in the widely read first volume of Das 
ipital: every reference it made to workers and capi- 
ists shewed that Marx had never breathed industrial 


Back to Methuselah lxix 


air, and had dug his case out of bluebooks in the British 
Museum. Compared to Darwin, he seemed to have no 
power of observation: there was not a fact in Das 
Kapital that had not been taken out of a book, nor a 
discussion that had not been opened by somebody else’s 
pamphlet. No matter: he exposed the bourgeoisie and | 
made an end of its moral prestige. That was enough: 
like Darwin he had for the moment the World Will by 
the ear. Marx had, too, what Darwin had not: im- 
placability and a fine Jewish literary gift, with terrible 
powers of hatred, invective, irony, and all the bitter 
qualities bred, first in the oppression of a rather pam- 
pered young genius (Marx was the spoilt child of a 
well-to-do family) by a social system utterly uncon- 
genial to him, and later on by exile and poverty. Thus 
Marx and Darwin between them toppled over two closely 
related idols, and became the prophets of two new creeds. 


Why Darwin Pleased the Profiteers Also 


But how, at this rate, did Darwin succeed with the 
capitalists too? It is not easy to make the best of both 
worlds when one of the worlds is preaching a Class War, 
and the other vigorously practising it. The explanation 
is that Darwinism was so closely related to Capitalism 
that Marx regarded it as an economic product rather 
than as a biological theory. Darwin got his main 
postulate, the pressure of population on the available 
means of subsistence, from the treatise of Malthus on 
Population, just as he got his other postulate of a 
practically unlimited time for that pressure to operate 
from the geologist Lyell, who made an end of Arch- 
bishop Ussher’s Biblical estimate of the age of the earth 
as 4004 8.c. plus a.p. The treatises of the Ricardian 
economists on the Law of Diminishing Return, which 


Ixx Back to Methuselah 


was only the Manchester School’s version of the giraffe 
and the trees, were all very fiercely discussed when 
Darwin was a young man. In fact the discovery in the 
eighteenth century by the French Physiocrats of the 
economic effects of Commercial Selection in soils and 
sites, and by Malthus of a competition for subsistence 
which he attributed to pressure of population on avail- 
able subsistence, had already brought political science 
into that unbreathable atmosphere of fatalism which is 
the characteristic blight of Darwinism. Long before 
Darwin published a line, the Ricardo-Malthusian econo- 
mists were preaching the fatalistic Wages Fund doc- 
trine, and assuring the workers that Trade Unionism is 
a vain deftance of the inexorable laws of political 
economy, just as the Neo-Darwinians were presently 
assuring us that Temperance Legislation is a vain de- 
fiance of Natural Selection, and that the true way to 
dea! with drunkenness is to flood the country with cheap 
gin and let the fittest survive. Cobdenism is, after all, 
nothing but the abandonment of trade to Circumstantial 
Selection. 

Tt is hardly possible to exaggerate the importance of 
this preparation for Darwinism by a vast political and 
clerical propaganda of its moral atmosphere. Never in 
history, as far as we know, had there been such a deter- 
mined, richly subsidized, politically organized attempt 
to persuade the human race that all progress, all 
prosperity, all salvation, individual and social, depend 
on an unrestrained conflict for food and money, on the 
suppression and elimination of the weak by the strong, 
on Free Trade, Free Contract, Free Competition, Nat- 
ural Liberty, Laisser-faire: in short, on “doing the 
other fellow down” with impunity, all interference by a 
guidmg government, all organization except police 
organization to protect legalized fraud against fisticuffs, 


Back to Methuselah Ixx; 


all attempt to introduce human purpose and design ana 
forethought into the industrial welter being “contrary 
to the laws of political economy.” Even the proletariat 
sympathized, though to them Capitalist liberty meant 
only wage slavery without the legal safeguards of 
chattel slavery. People were tired of governments and 
kings and priests and providences, and wanted to find 
out how Nature would arrange matters if she were let 
alone. And they found it out to their cost in the days 
when Lancashire used up nine generations of wage slaves 
in one generation of their masters. But their masters, 
becoming richer and richer, were very well satisfied; and 
Bastiat proved convincingly that Nature had arranged 
Economic Harmonies which would settle social questions 
far better than theocracies or aristocracies or mobo- 
cracies, the real deus ex machina being unrestrained 
plutocracy. 


The Poetry and Purity of Materialism 


Thus the stars in their courses fought for Darwin. 
Every faction drew a moral from him; every catholic 
hater of faction founded a hope on him; every black- 
guard felt justified by him; and every saint felt en- 
couraged by him. The notion that any harm could 
come of so splendid an enlightenment seemed as silly as 
the notion that the atheists would steal all our spoons. 
The physicists went further than the Darwinians. 
Tyndall declared that he saw in Matter the promise 
and potency of all forms of life, and with his Irish 
graphic lucidity made a picture of a world of magnetic 
atoms, each atom with a positive and a negative pole, 
arranging itself by attraction and repulsion in orderly 
crystalline structure. Such a picture is dangerously 


fascinating to thinkers oppressed by the bloody dis- 


lxxii Back to Methuselah 


orders of the living world. Craving for purer subjects 
of thought, they find in the contemplation of crystals 
and magnets a happiness more dramatic and less childish 
than the happiness found by the mathematicians in 
abstract numbers, because they see in the crystals beauty 
and movement without the corrupting appetites of 
fleshly vitality. In such Materialism as that of 
Lucretius and Tyndall there is a nobility which produces 
poetry : John Davidson found his highest inspiration in it. 
Even its pessimism as it faces the cooling of the sun and 
the return of the ice caps does not degrade the pessimist: 
for example, the Quincy Adamses, with their insistence 
on modern democratic degradation as an inevitable 
result of solar shrinkage, are not dehumanized as the 
vivisectionists are. Perhaps nobody is at heart fool 
enough to believe that life is at the mercy of tempera- 
ture: Dante was not troubled by the objection that 
Brunetto could not have lived in the fire nor Ugolino in 
the ice. 

But the physicists found their intellectual vision of 
the world incommunicable to those who were not born 
with it. It came to the public simply as Materialism; 
and Materialism lost its peculiar purity and dignity 
when it entered into the Darwinian reaction against 
Bible fetichism. Between the two of them religion was 
knocked to pieces; and where there had been a god, a 
cause, a faith that the universe was ordered however 
inexplicable by us its order might be, and therefore a 
sense of moral responsibility as part of that order, there 
was now an utter void. Chaos had come again. The 
first effect was exhilarating: we had the runaway child’s 
sense of freedom before it gets hungry and lonely and 
frightened. In this phase we did not desire our God 
back again. We printed the verses in which William 
Blake, the most religious of our great poets, called the 


Back to Methuselah Ixxiil 


anthropomorphic ido] Old Nobodaddy, and gibed at him 
in terms which the printer had to leave us to guess from 
his blank spaces. We had heard the parson droning that 
God is not mocked; and it was great fun to mock Him 
to our hearts’ content and not be a penny the worse. It 
did not occur to us that Old Nobodaddy, instead of 
being a ridiculous fiction, might be only an imposter, and 
that the exposure of this Koepenik Captain of the 
heavens, far from proving that there was no real cap- 
tain, rather proved the contrary: that, in short, Nobo- 
daddy could not have impersonated anybody if there 
had not been Somebodaddy to impersonate. We did not 
see the significance of the fact that on the last occasion 
on which God had been “expelled with a pitchfork,”? men 
so different as Voltaire and Robespierre had said, the one 
that if God did not exist it would be necessary to invent 
him, and the other that after an honest attempt to dis- 
pense with a Supreme Being in practical politics, some 
such hypothesis had been found quite indispensable, and 
could not be replaced by a mere Goddess of Reason. If 
these two opinions were quoted at all, they were quoted 
as jokes at the expense of Nobodaddy. We were quite 
sure for the moment that whatever lingering super- 
stition might have daunted these men of the eighteenth 
century, we Darwinians could do without God, and had > 
made a good riddance of him. 


The Viceroys of the King of Kings 


Now in politics it is much easier to do without God 
than to do without his viceroys and vicars and lien- 
tenants; and we begin to miss the lieutenants long before 
we begin to miss their principal. Roman Catholics do 
what their confessors advise without troubling God; and 
Royalists are content to worship the King and ask the 


Ixxiv Back to Methuselah 


policeman, But God’s trustiest lieutenants often lack 
official credentials. ‘They may be professed atheists who 
are also men of honor and high public spirit. The old 
belief that it matters dreadfully to God whether a man 
thinks himself an atheist or not, and that the extent to 
which it matters can be stated with exactness as one 
single damn, was an error; for the divinity is in the 
honor and public spirit, not in the mouthed credo or non_ 
credo. 'The consequences of this error became grave 
when the fitness of a man for public trust was tested, 
not by his honor and public spirit, but by asking him 
whether he believed in Nobodaddy or not. If he said 
yes, he was held fit to be a Prime Minister, though, as 
our ablest Churchman has said, the real implication was 
that he was either a fool, a bigot, or a liar. Darwin 
destroyed this test; but when it was only thoughtlessly 
dropped, there was no test at all; and the door to public 
trust was open to the man who had no sense of God 
because he had no sense of anything beyond his own 
business interests and personal appetites and ambitions. 
As a result, the people who did not feel in the least in- 
convenienced by being no longer governed by Nobodaddy 
soon found themselves very acutely inconvenienced by 
being governed by fools and commercial adventurers. 
They had forgotten not only God but Goldsmith, who 
had warned them that “honor sinks where commerce long 
prevails.” 

The lieutenants of God are not always persons: some 
of them are legal and parliamentary fictions. One of 
them is Public Opinion. The pre-Darwinian statesmen 
and publicists were not restrained directly by God; but 
they restrained themselves by setting up an image of a 
Public Opinion which would not tolerate any attempt to 
tamper with British liberties. ‘Their favorite way of 
putting it was that any Government which proposed 


Back to Methuselah Ixxv 


such and such an infringement of such and such a Brit- 
ish liberty would be hurled from office in a week. This 
was not true:there was no such public opinion, no limit 
to what the British people would put up with in the 
abstract, and no hardship short of immediate and sud- 
den starvation that it would not and did not put up 
with in the concrete. But this very helplessness of the 
people had forced their rulers to pretend that they were 
not helpless, and that the certainty of a sturdy and un- 
conquerable popular resistance forbade any trifling with 
Magna Carta or the Petition of Rights or the authority 
of parliament. Now the reality behind this fiction was 
the divine sense that liberty is a need vital to human 
growth. Accordingly, though it was difficult enough to 
effect a political reform, yet, once parliament had passed 
it, its wildest opponent had no hope that the Govern- 
ment would cancel it, or shelve it, or be bought off from 
executing it. From Walpole to Campbell Bannerman 
there was no Prime Minister to whom such renagueing 
or trafficking would ever have occurred, though there 
were plenty who employed corruption unsparingly to 
procure the votes of members of parliament for their 


policy. 


Political Opportunism in Excelsis 

The moment Nobodaddy was slain by Darwin, Public 
Opinion, as divine deputy, lost its sanctity. Politicians 
no longer told themselves that the British public would 
never suffer this or that: they allowed themselves to 
know that for their own personal purposes, which are 
limited to their ten or twenty years on the front benches 
in parliament, the British Public can be humbugged and 
coerced into believing and suffering everything that it 
rays to impose on them, and that any false excuse for 
gis Unpopular step will serve if it can be kept in coun- 


Ixxvl Back to Methuselah 


tenance for a fortnight: that is, until the terms of the 
excuse are forgotten. The people, untaught or mis-~ 
taught, are so ignorant and incapable politically that 
this in itself would not greatly matter; for a statesman 
who told them the truth would not be understood, and 
would in effect mislead them more completely than if he 
dealt with them according to their blindness instead of 
to his own wisdom. But though there is no difference 
in this respect between the best demagogue and the 
worst, both of them having to present their cases equally 
in terms of melo-drama, there is all the difference in 
the world between the statesman who is humbugging the 
people into allowing him to do the will of God, in what- 
ever disguise it may come to him, and one who is hum- 
bugging them into furthering his personal ambition and 
the commercial interests of the plutocrats who own the 
newspapers and support him on reciprocal terms. And 
there 1s almost as great a difference between the states- 
man who does this naively and automatically, or even 
does it telling himself that he is ambitious and selfish 
and unscrupulous, and the one who does it on principle, 
believing that if everyone takes the line of least mate- 
rial resistance the result will be the survival of the fittest 
in a perfectly harmonious universe. Once produce an 
atmosphere of fatalism on principle, and it matters little 
what the opinions or superstitions of the individual 
statesmen concerned may be. A Kaiser who is a devout 
reader of sermons, a Prime Minister who is an emotional 
singer of hymns, and a General who is a bigoted Roman 
Catholic may be the executants of the policy; but the 
policy itself will be one of unprincipled opportunism; 
and all the Governments will be like the tramp who walks 
always with the wind and ends as a pauper, or the stone 
that rolls down the hill and ends as an avalanche: their 
way 1s the way to destruction.

The Betrayal of Western Civilization 


Within sixty years from the publication of Darwin’s 
Origin of Species political opportunism had brought 
parliaments into contempt; created a popular demand for 
direct action by the organized industries (‘‘Syndical- 
ism”) ; and wrecked the centre of Europe in a paroxysm 
of that chronic terror of one another, that cowardice of 
the irreligious, which, masked in the bravado of mil- 
itarist patriotism, had ridden the Powers like a night- 
mare since the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. The 
sturdy old cosmopolitan Liberalism vanished almost un- 
noticed. At the present moment all the new ordinances 
for the government of our Crown Colonies contain, as a 
matter of course, prohibitions of all criticism, spoken 
or written, of their ruling officials, which would have 
scandalized George III and elicited Liberal pamphlets 
from Catherine II. Statesmen are afraid of the suburbs, 
of the newspapers, of the profiteers, of the diplomatists, 
of the militarists, of the country houses, of the trade 
unions, of everything ephemeral on earth except the 
revolutions they are provoking; and they would be 
afraid of these if they were not too ignorant of society 
and history to appreciate the risk, and to know that a 
revolution always seems hopeless and impossible the day 
before it breaks out, and indeed never does break out 
until it seems hopeless and impossible; for rulers who 
think it possible take care to insure the risk by ruling 
reasonably. This brings about a condition fatal to all 
political stability: namely, that you never know where 
to have the politicians. If the fear of God was in them 
it might be possible to come to some genera] understand- 
ing as to what God disapproves of; and Europe might 
pull together on that basis. But the present panic, 
=, which Prime Ministers drift from election to election, 


lxxviil Back to Methuselah 


either fighting or running away from everybody who 
shakes a fist at them, makes a European civilization im- 
possible. Such peace and prosperity as we enjoyed 
before the war depended on the loyalty of the Western 
States to their own civilization. That loyalty could find 
practical expression only in an alliance of the highly 
civilized Western Powers against the primitive tyrannies 
of the East. Britain, Germany, France, and the United 
States of America could have imposed peace on the 
world, and nursed modern civilization in Russia, Turkey, 
and the Balkans. Every meaner consideration should 
have given way to this need for the solidarity of the 
higher civilization. What actually happened was that 
France and England, through their clerks the diplomat- 
ists, made an alliance with Russia to defend themselves 
against Germany; Germany made an alliance with 
Turkey to defend herself against the three; and the two 
unnatural and suicidal combinations fell on one another 
in a war that came nearer to being a war of extermina- 
tion than any wars since those of Timur the Tartar; 
whilst the United States held aloof as long as they could, . 
and the other States either did the same or joined in the 
fray through compulsion, bribery, or their judgment 
as to which side their bread was buttered. And at the 
present moment, though the main fighting has ceased 
through the surrender of Germany on terms which the 
victors have never dreamt of observing, the extermina- 
tion by blockade and famine, which was what forced 
Germany to surrender, still continues, although it is 
certain that if the vanquished starve the victors will 
starve too, and Europe will liquidate its affairs by going, 
not into bankruptcy, but into chaos. 

Now all this it will be noticed, was fundamentally 
nothing but an idiotic attempt on the part of each bel- 
ligerent State to secure for itself the advantage of the 


Back to Methuselah Ixxix 


survival of the fittest through Circumstantial Selection. 
If the Western Powers had selected their allies in the 
Lamarckian manner intelligently, purposely ,and vitally, 
ad majorem Dei gloriam, as what Nietzsche called good 
Europeans, there would have been a League of Nations 
and no war. But because the selection relied on was 
purely circumstantial opportunist selection, so that the 
alliances were mere marriages of convenience, they have 
turned out, not merely as badly as might have been ex- 
pected, but far worse than the blackest pessimist had 
ever Imagined possible. 


Circumstantial Selection in Finance 


How it will all end we do not yet know. When wolves 
combine to kill a horse, the death of the horse only sets 
them fighting one another for the choicest morsels. Men 
are no better than wolves if they have no better princi- 
ples: accordingly, we find that the Armistice and the 
Treaty have not extricated us from the war. A hand- 
ful of Serbian assassins flung us into it as a sporting 
navvy throws a bull pup at a cat; but the Supreme 
Council, with all its victorious legions and all its pres- 
tige, cannot get us out of it, though we are heartily sick 
and tired of the whole business, and know now very well 
that it should never have been allowed to happen. But 
we are helpless before a slate scrawled with figures of 
National Debts. As there is no money to pay them be- 
cause it was all spent on the war (wars have to be paid 
for on the nail) the sensible thing to do is to wipe the 
slate and let the wrangling States distribute what they 
can spare, on the sound communist principle of from 
each according to his ability, to each according to his 
_-od. But no: we have no principles left, not even com- 


hme 


mercial ones; for what sane commercialist would decree 


lxxx Back to Methuselah 


that France must not pay for her failure to defend her 
own soil; that Germany must pay for her success in 
carrying the war into the enemy’s country; and that as 
Germany has not the money to pay, and under our com- 
mercial system can make it only by becoming once more 
a commercial competitor of England and France, which 
neither of them will allow, she must borrow the money 
from England, or America, or even from France: an 
arrangement by which the victorious creditors will pay 
one another, and wait to get their money back until 
Germany is either strong enough to refuse to pay or 
ruined beyond the possibility of paying? Meanwhile 
Russia, reduced to a scrap of fish and a pint of cabbage 
soup a day, has fallen into the hands of rulers who per- 
ceive that Materialist Communism is at all events more 
effective than Materialist’ Nihilism, and are attempting 
to move in an intelligent and ordered manner, practising 
a very strenuous Intentional Selection of workers as 
fitter to survive than idlers; whilst the Western Powers 
are drifting and colliding and running on the rocks, in 
the hope that if they continue to do their worst they will 
get Naturally Selected for survival without the trouble 
of thinking about it. 


The Homeopathic Reaction Against Darwinism 


When, like the Russians our Nihilists have it urgently 
borne in on them, by the brute force of rising wages that 
never overtake rising prices, that they are being Nat- 
urally Selected for destruction, they will perhaps remem- 
ber that “Dont Care came to a bad end,” and begin to 
Jook round for a religion. And the whole purpose of 
this book is to shew them where to look. For, through- 
out all the godless weltér of ‘the infidel half-century, 
Darwinism has been acting not only directly but homeo- 


Back to Methuselah Ixxxi 


pathically, its poison rallying our vital forces not only 
to resist it and cast it out, but to achieve a new Reforma- 
tion and put a credible and healthy religion in its place. 
Samuel Butler was the pioneer of the reaction as far as 
the casting out was concerned; but the issue was con- 
fused by the physiologists, who were divided on the ques- 
tion into Mechanists and Vitalists. The Mechanists said 
that life is nothing but physical and chemical action; 
that they have demonstrated this in many cases of so- 
called vital phenomena; and that there is no reason to 
doubt that with improved methods they will presently be 
able to demonstrate it in all of them. The Vitalists said 
that a dead body and a live one are physically and chem- 
ically identical, and that the difference can be accounted 
for only by the existence of a Vital Force. This seems 
simple; but the Anti-Mechanists objected to be called Vi- 
talists (obviously the right name for them) on two con- 
tradictory grounds. First, that vitality is scientifically 
inadmissible, because it cannot be isolated and experi- 
mented with in the laboratory. Second, that force, being 
by definition anything that can alter the speed or direc- 
tion, of matter in motion (briefly, that can overcome 
inertia), is essentially a mechanistic conception. Here 
we had the New Vitalist only half extricated from the 
Old Mechanist, objecting to be called either, and unable 
to give a clear lead in the new direction. And there was 
a deeper antagonism. The Old Vitalists, in postulating 
a Vital Force, were setting up a comparatively mechani- 
cal conception as against the divine idea of the life 
breathed into the clay nostrils of Adam, whereby he be- 
came a living soul. The New Vitalists, filled by their 
laboratory researches with a sense of the miraculousness 
of life that went far beyond the comparatively unin- 
formed imaginations of the authors of the Book of Gene- 
sis, regarded the Old Vitalists as Mechanists who had 


Ixxxii Back to Methuselah 


tried to fill up the gulf between life and death with an 
empty phrase denoting an imaginary physical force. 

These professional faction fights are ephemeral, and 
need not trouble us here. The Old Vitalist, who was 
essentially a Materialist, has evolved into the New Vital- 
ist, who is, as every genuine scientist must be, finally a 
metaphysician. And as the New Vitalist turns from the 
disputes of his youth to the future of his science, he will 
cease to boggle at the name Vitalist, or at the inevitable, 
ancient, popular, and quite correct use of the term Force 
to denote metaphysical as well as physical overcomers of 
inertia. 

Since the discovery of Evolution as the method of the 
Life Force, the religion of metaphysical Vitalism has 
been gaining the definiteness and concreteness needed to 
make it assimilable by the educated critical man. But 
it has always been with us.. ‘The popular religions, dis- 
graced by their Opportunist cardinals and bishops, have 
been kept in credit by canonized samts whose secret was 
their conception of themselves as the instruments and 
vehicles of divine power and aspiration: a conception 
which at moments becomes an actual experience of 
ecstatic possession by that power. And above and below 
all have been millions of humble and obscure persons, 
sometimes totally illiterate, sometimes unconscious of 
having any religion at all, sometimes believing in their 
simpucity that the gods and temples and priests of their 
district stood for their instinctive righteousness, who 
have kept sweet the tradition that good people follow 
a light that shines within and above and ahead of them, 
that bad people care only for themselves, and that the 
good are saved and blessed and the bad damned and 
miserable. Protestantism was a movement towards the 
pursuit of a light called an inner light because every 
man must see it with his own eyes and not take any 


Back to Methuselah Ixxxlll 


priest’s words for it or any Church’s account of it. In 
short, there is no question of a new religion, but rather 
of redistilling the eternal spirit of religion and thus ex- 
tricating it from the sludgy residue of temporalities and 
legends that are making belief impossible, though they 
are the stock-in-trade of all the Churches and all the 
Schools. 


Religion and Romance 


It is the adulteration of religion by the romance of 
miracles and paradises and torture chambers that makes 
it ree] at the impact of every advance in science, instead 
of being clarified by it. If you take an English village 
lad, and teach him that religion means believing that the 
stories of Noah’s Ark and the Garden of Eden are liter- 
ally true on the authority of God himself, and if that 
boy becomes an artisan and goes into the town among 
the sceptical city proletariat, then, when the jibes of his 
mates set him thinking, and he sees that these stories 
cannot be literally true, and learns that no candid pre- 
late now pretends to believe them, he does not make any 
fine distinctions: he declares at once that religion is a 
fraud, and parsons and teachers hypocrites and liars. 
He becomes indifferent to religion if he has little con- 
science, and indignantly hostile to it if he has a good 
deal. 

The same revolt against wantonly false teaching is 
happening daily in the professional classes whose recrea- 
tion is reading and whose intellectual sport is contro- 
versy. They banish the Bible from their houses, and 
sometimes put into the hands of their unfortunate chil- 
dren Ethical and Rationalist tracts of the deadliest dull- 
ness, compelling these wretched infants to sit out the 
discourses of Secularist Jecturers (I have delivered some 


Ixxxiv Back to Methuselah 


of them myself), who bore them at a length now for- 
bidden by custom in the established pulpit. Our minds 
have reacted so violently towards provable logical theo- 
rems and demonstrable mechanical or chemical] facts that 
we have become incapable of metaphysical] truth, and 
try to cast out incredible and silly lies by credible and 
clever ones, calling in Satan to cast out Satan, and 
getting more into his clutches than ever in the process. 
Thus the world is kept sane less by the saints than by 
the vast mass of the indifferent, who neither act nor 
react in the matter. Butler’s preaching of the gospel 
of Laoddica was a piece of common sense founded on 
his observation of this. 

But indifference will not guide nations through civili- 
zation to the establishment of the perfect city of God. 
An indifferent statesman is a contradiction in terms; 
and a statesman who is indifferent on principle, a Lais- 
ser-faire or Muddle-Through doctrinaire, plays the deuce 
with us in the long run. Our statesmen must get a 
religion by hook or crook; and as we are committed to 
Adult Suffrage it must be a religion capable of vulgari- 
_ gation. The thought first put into words by the Mills 
when they said “There 1s no God; but this is a family 
secret,” and long held unspoken by aristocratic states- 
men and diplomatists, will not serve now; for the revival 
of civilization after the war cannot be effected by artificial 
breathing: the driving force of an undeluded popular 
consent is indispensable, and will be impossible until the 
statesman can appeal to the vital instincts of the people 
in terms of a common religion. The success of the Hang 
the Kaiser cry at the last Genera] Election shews us very 
terrifyingly how a common irreligion can be used by 
myopic demagogy; and common irreligion will destroy 
civilization unless it is countered by common religion.

The Danger of Reaction 


And here arises the danger that when we realize this 
we shall do just what we did half a century ago, and 
what Pliable did in The Pilgrim’s Progress when Chris- 
tian landed him in the Slough of Despond: that is, run 
back in terror to our old superstitions. We jumped out 
of the frying-pan into the fire; and we are just as likely 
to jump back again, now that we feel hotter than ever. 
History records very little in the way of mental activity 
on the part of the mass of mankind except a series of 
stampedes from affirmative errors into negative ones and 
back again. It must therefore be said very precisely 
and clearly that the bankruptcy of Darwinism does not 
mean that Nobodaddy was Somebodaddy with “body, 
parts, and passions” after all; that the world was made 
in the year 4004 8.c.; that damnation means an eternity 
of blazing brimstone; that the Immaculate Conception 
means that sex is sinful and that Christ was partheno- 
genetically brought forth by a virgin descended in like 
manner from a line of virgins right back to Eve; that 
the Trinity is an anthropomorphic monster with three 
heads which are yet only one head; that in Rome the 
bread and wine on the altar become flesh and blood, and 
in England, in a still more mystical manner, they do and 
they do not; that the Bible is an infallible scientific 
manual, an accurate historical chronicle, and a complete 
guide to conduct; that we may lie and cheat and murder 
and then wash ourselves innocent in the blood of the lamb 
on Sunday at the cost of a credo and a penny in the 
plate, and so on and so forth. Civilization cannot be 
saved by people not only crude enough to believe these 
things, but irreligious enough to believe that such belief 
constitutes a religion. ‘The education of children can- 
not safely be left in their hands. If dwindling sects 


Ixxxvi Back to Methuselah 


like the Church of England, the Church of. Rome, the 
Greek Church, and the rest, persist in trying to cramp 
the human mind within the limits of these grotesque 
perversions of natural truths and poetic metaphors, then 
they must be ruthlessly banished from the schools until 
they either perish in general contempt or discover the 
soul that is hidden in every dogma. The real Class War 
will be a war of intédllectual classes; and its conquest will 


be the souls of the children. 


A Touchstone for Dogma 


The test of a dogma is its universality. As long as 
the Church of England preaches a single doctrine that 
the Brahman, the Buddhist, the Mussulman, the Parsee, 
and all the other sectarians who are British subjects 
cannot accept, it has no legitimate place in the counsels 
of the British Commonwealth, and will remain what it 
is at present, a corrupter of youth, a danger to the 
State, and an obstruction to the fellowship of the Holy 
Ghost. This has never been more strongly felt than at 
present, after a war in which the Church failed grossly 
in the courage of its profession, and sold its lilies for 
the laurels of the soldiers of the Victoria Cross. ‘All 
the cocks in Christendom have been crowing shame on it 
ever since; and it will not be spared for the sake of the 
two or three faithful who were found even among the 
bishops. Let the Church take it on authority, even my 
authority (as a professional legend maker) if it cannot 
see the truth by its own light: no dogma can be a legend. 
A legend can pass an ethnical frontier as a legend, but 
not as a truth; whilst the only frontier to the currency 
of a sound dogma as such is the frontier of capacity for 
understanding it. 

This does not mean that we should throw away legend 


Back to Methuselah Ixxxvll 


and parable and drama: they are the natural vehicles of 
dogma; but woe to the Churches and rulers who substi- 
tute the legend for the dogma, the parable for the his- 
tory, the drama for the religion! Better by far declare 
the throne of God empty than set a liar and a fool on 
it. What are called wars of religion are always wars 
to destroy religion by affirming the historical truth or 
material substantiality of some legend, and killing thase 
who refuse to accept it as historical or substantial. But 
who has ever refused to accept a good legend with delight 
asalegend? The legends, the parables, the dramas, are 
among the choicest treasures of mankind. No one is 
ever tired of stories of miracles. In vain did Mahomet 
repudiate the miracles ascribed to him: in vain did Christ 
furiously scold those who asked him to give them an 
exhibition as a conjuror: in vain did the saints declare 
that God chose them not for their powers but for their 
weaknesses; that the humble might be exalted, and the 
proud rebuked. People will have their miracles, their 
stories, their heroes and heroines and saints and martyrs 
and divinities to exercise their gifts of affection, admi- 
ration, wonder, and worship, and their Judases and 
devils to enable them to be angry and yet feel that they 
do well to be angry. Every one of these legends is the 
common heritage of the human race; and there is only 
one inexorable condition attached to their healthy enjoy- 
ment, which is that no one shall believe them literally. 
The reading of stories and delighting in them made 
Don Quixote a gentleman: the believing them literally 
made him a madman who slew lambs instead of feeding 
them. In England to-day good books of Eastern relli- 
gious legends are read eagerly; and Protestants and 
Atheists read Roman Catholic legends of the Saints with 
pleasure. But such fare is shirked by Indians and 
Roman Catholics. Freethinkers read the Bible: indeed 


Ilxxxviil Back to Methuselah 


they seem to be its only readers now except the reluctant 
parsons at the church lecterns, who communicate their 
discomfort to the congregation by gargling the words 
in their throats in an unnatural] manner that is as repul- 
sive as it is unintelligible. And this is because the im- 
position of the legends as literal truths at once changes 
them from parables into falsehoods. The feeling 
against the Bible has become so strong at last that edu- 
cated people not only refuse to outrage their intellectual 
consciences by reading the legend of Noah’s Ark, with 
its funny beginning about the animals and its exquisite 
end about the birds: they will not read even the chronicles 
of King David, which may very well be true, and are 
certainly more candid than the official biographies of 
our contemporary monarchs. 


What to Do With the Legends 


What we should do, then, is to pool our legends and 
make a delightful stock of religious folk-lore on an 
honest basis for all mankind. With our minds freed 
from pretence and falsehood we could enter into the 
heritage of all the faiths. China would share her sages 
with Spain, and Spain her saints with China. The 
Ulster man who now gives his son an unmerciful thrash- 
ing if the boy is so tactless as to ask how the evening 
and the morning could be the first day before the sun 
was created, or to betray an innocent calf-love for the 
Virgin Mary, would buy him a bookful of legends of 
the creation and of mothers of God from all parts of 
the world, and be very glad to find his laddie as inter- 
ested in such things as in marbles or Police and Rob- 
bers. That would be better than beating all good feel- 
ing towards religion out of the child, and blackening 
his mind by teaching him that the worshippers of the 


Back to Methuselah Ixxxix 


holy virgins, whether of the Parthenon or St. Peter’s, 
are fire-doomed heathens and idolaters. All the sweet- 
ness of religion is conveyed to the world by the hands 
of story-tellers and image-makers. Without their fic- 
tions the truths of religion would for the multitude be 
neither intelligible nor even apprehensible; and the 
prophets would prophesy and the teachers teach in vain. 
And nothing stands between the people and the fictions 
except the silly falsehood that the fictions are literal 
truths, and that there is nothing in religion but fiction. 


A Lesson from Science to the Churches 


Let the Churches ask themselves why there is no revolt 
against the dogmas of mathematics though there is one 
against the dogmas of religion. It is not that the 
mathematical dogmas are more comprehensible. The 
law of inverse squares is as incomprehensible to the 
common man as the Athanasian creed. It is not 
that science is free from legends, witchcraft, mira- 
cles, biographic boostings of quacks as heroes and 
saints, and of barren scoundrels as explorers and dis- 
coverers. On the contrary, the iconography and hagi- 
ology of Scientism are as copious as they are mostly 
squalid. But no student of science has yet been taught 
that specific gravity consists in the belief that Archi- 
medes jumped out of his bath and ran naked through 
the streets of Syracuse shouting Eureka, Eureka, or 
that the law of inverse squares must be discarded if any- 
one can prove that Newton was never in an orchard in 
his life. When some unusually conscientious or enter- 
prising bacteriologist reads the pamphlets of Jenner, 
and discovers that they might have been written by an 
ignorant but curious and observant nurserymaid, and 
could not possibly have been written by any person with ° 


xe Back to Methuselah 


a scientifically trained mind, he does not feel that the 
whole edifice of science has collapsed and crumbled, and 
that there is no such thing as smallpox. It may come 
to that yet; for hygiene, as it forces its way into our 
schools, is being taught as falsely as religion is taught 
there; but in mathematics and physics the faith 1is still 
kept pure, and you may take the law and leave the 
legends without suspicion of heresy. Accordingly, the 
tower of the mathematician stands unshaken whilst the 
temple of the priest rocks to its foundation. 


The Religious art of the Twentieth Century 


Creative Evolution is already a religion, and is indeed 
now unmistakably the religion of the twentieth century, 
newly arisen from the ashes of pseudo-Christianity, of 
mere scepticism, and of the soulless affirmations and 
blind negations of the Mechanists and Neo-Darwinians. 
But it cannot become a popular religion until it has its 
legends, its parables, its miracles. And when I say pop- 
ular I do not mean apprehensible by villagers only. I 
mean apprehensible by Cabinet Ministers as well. It is 
unreasonable to look to the professional politician ind 
administrator for light and leading in religion. He is 
neither a philosopher nor a prophet: if he were, he would 
be philosophizing and prophesying, and not neglecting 
both for the drudgery of practical government. Soc- 
rates and Coleridge did not remain soldiers, nor could 
John Stuart Mill remain the representative of West- 
minster in the House of Commons even when he was 
willing. ‘The Westminster electors admired Mill for 
telling them that much of the difficulty of dealing with 
them arose from their being inveterate liars. But they 
would not vote a second time for the man who was not 
afraid to break the crust of mendacity on which they 


Back to Methuselah xcl 


were all dancing; for it seemed to them that there was 
a volcanic abyss beneath, not having his philosophic con- 
viction that the truth is the solidest standing ground in 
the end. Your front bench man will always be an ex- 
ploiter of the popular religion or irreligion. Not being 
an expert, he must take it as he finds it; and before he 
can take it, he must have been told stories abont it in 
his childhood and had before him all his life an elaborate 
iconography of it produced by writers, painters, sculp- 
tors, temple arohitects, and artists of all the higher sorts. 
Even if, as sometimes happens, he is a bit of an amateur, 
in metaphysics as well as a professional politician, he 
must still govern according to the popular iconography, 
and not according to his own personal interpretations 
if these happen to be heterodox. 

It will be seen then that the revival of religion on a 
scientific basis does not mean the death of art, but a 
glorious rebirth of it. Indeed art has never been great 
when it was not providing an iconography for a live 
religion. And it has never been quite contemptible ex- 
cept when imitating the iconography after the religion 
had become a superstition. Italian painting from 
Giotto to Carpaccio is all religious painting; and it 
moves us deeply and has real greatness. Compare with 
it the attempts of our painters a century ago to achieve 
the effects of the old masters by imitation when they 
should have been illustrating a faith of their own. Con- 
template, if you can bear it, the dull daubs of Hilton 
and Haydon, who knew so much more about drawing and 
scumbling and glazing and perspective and anatomy and 
“marvellous foreshortening”’ than Giotto, the latchet of 
whose shoe they were nevertheless not worthy to nnloose. 
Compare Mozart’s Magic Flute, Beethoven’s Ninth 
Symphony, Wagner’s Ring, all of them reachings-for- 
ward to the new Vitalist art, with the dreary pseudo- 


xcll Back to Methuselah 


sacred oratories and cantatas which were produced for 
no better reason than that Handel had formerly made 
splendid thunder in that way, and with the stale confec- 
tionery, mostly too would-be pious to be even cheerfully 
toothsome, of Spohr and Mendelssohn, Stainer and 
Parry, which spread indigestion at our musical festivals 
until I publicly told Parry the bludgeoning truth about 
his Job and woke him to conviction of sin. Compare 
Flaxman and Thorwaldsen and Gibson and Phidias and 
Praxiteles, Stevens with Michael Angelo, Bouguereau’s 
Virgin with Cimabue’s, or the best operatic Christs of 
Scheffer and Miller with the worst Christs that the 
worst painters could paint before the end of the fifteenth 
century, and you must feel that until we have a great 
religious movement we cannot hope for a great artistic 
one. The disillusioned Raphael could paint a mother 
and child, but not a queen of Heaven as much less skil- 
ful men had done in the days of his great-grandfather ; 
yet he could reach forward to the twentieth century and 
paint a Transfiguration of the Son of Man as they could 
not. Also, please note, he could decorate a house of 
pleasure for a cardinal very beautifully with voluptuous 
pictures of Cupid and Psyche; for this simple sort of 
Vitalism is always with us, and, like portrait painting, 
keeps the artist supplied with subject matter in the in- 
tervals between the ages of faith; so that your sceptical 
Rembrandts and Velasquezs are at least not compelled 
to paint shop fronts for want of anything else to paint 
in which they can really believe. 


The Artist-Prophets 


And there are always certain rare but intensely inter- 
esting anticipations. Michael Angelo could not very well 
believe in Julius II or Leo X, or in much that they be- 


DacK to ivLethuselah XClil 


lieved in; but he could paint the Superman three hun- 
dred years before Nietzsche wrote Also Sprach Zara- 
thustra and Strauss set it to music. Michael Angelo 
won the primacy among all modern painters and sculp- 
tors solely by his power of shewing us superhuman per- 
sons. On the strength of his decoration and color alone 
he would hardly have survived his own death twenty 
years; and even his design would have had only an aca- 
demic interest; but as a painter of prophets and sibyls 
he is greatest among the very greatest in his craft, be- 
cause we aspire to a world of prophets and sybils. 
Beethoven never heard of radio-activity nor of electrons 
dancing in vortices of inconceivable energy; but pray 
can anyone explain the last movement of his Hammer- 
klavier Sonata, Opus 106, otherwise than as a musical 
picture of these whirling electrons? His contempo- 
raries said he was mad, partly perhaps because the 
movement was so hard to play; but we, who can make 
a pianola play it to us over and over until it is as 
familiar as Pop Goes the Weasel, know that it is sane 
and methodical. As such, it must represent something; 
and as all Beethoven’s serious compositions represent 
some process within himself, some nerve storm or soul 
storm, and the storm here is clearly one of physical 
movement, I should much like to know what other storm 
than the atomic storm could have driven him to this 
oddest of all those many expressions of cyclonic energy 
which have given him the same distinction among 
musicians that Michael Angelo has amcng draughtsmen. 

In Beethoven’s day the business of art was held to be 
‘the sublime and beautiful.”? In our day it has fallen 
to be the imitative and voluptuous. In both periods the 
word passionate has been freely employed; but in the 
sighteenth century passion meant irresistible impulse of 
the Joftiest kind: for example, a passion for astronomy 


XCIV Back to Methuselah 


or fo. truth. For us it has come to mean concupiscence 
and nothing else. One might say to the art of Europe 
what Antony said to the corpse of Cesar: “Are all thy 
conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, shrunk to this little 
measure?” But in fact it is the mind of Europe that 
has shrunk, being, as we have seen, wholly preoccupied 
with a busy spring-cleaning to get rid of its super- 
stitions before readjusting itself to the new conception 
of Evolution. 


Evolution in the Theatre 


On the stage (and here I come at last to my own par- 
ticular function in the matter), Comedy, as a destruc- 
tive, derisory, critical, negative art, kept the theatre 
open when sublime tragedy perished. From Moliére to 
Oscar Wilde we had a line of comedic playwrights who, 
if they had nothing fundamentally positive to say, were 
at least in revolt against falsehood and imposture, and 
were not only, as they claimed, “‘chastening morals by 
ridicule,” but, in Johnson’s phrase, clearing out minds 
of cant, and thereby shewing an uneasiness in the 
presence of error which is the surest symptom of intel- 
lectual vitality. Meanwhile the name of Tragedy was 
assumed by plays in which everyone was killed in the last 
act, just as, in spite of Moliére, plays in which everyone 
was married in the last act called themselves comedies. 
Now neither tragedies nor comedies can be produced 
according to a prescription which gives only the last 
moments of the last act. Shakespear did not make 
Hamlet out of its final butchery, nor Twelfth Night out 
of its final matrimony. And he could not become the 
conscious iconographer of a religion because he had no 
conscious religion. He had therefore to exercise his 
extraordinary natural gifts in the very entertaining art 


Back to Methuselah XeV. 


of mimicry, giving us the famous “delineation of char- 
acter” which make his plays, like the novels of Scott, 
Dumas, and Dickens, so delightful. Also, he developed 
that curious and questionable art of building us a refuge 
from despair by disguising the cruelties of Nature as 
jokes. But with all his gifts, the fact remains that he 
never found the inspiration to write an original play. 
He furbished up old plays, and adapted popular stories, 
and chapters of history from Holinshed’s Chronicle and 
Plutarch’s biographies, to the stage. All this he did 
(or did not; for there are minus quantities in the algebra 
of art) with a recklessness which shewed that his trade 
lay far from his conscience. It is true that he never 
takes his characters from the borrowed story, because 
it was less trouble and more fun to him to create them 
afresh; but none the less he heaps the murders and vil- 
lainies of the borrowed story on his own essentially 
gentle creations without scruple, no matter how incon- 
gruous they may be. And all the time his vital need for 
a philosophy drives him to seek one by the quaint pro- 
fessional method of introducing philosophers as char- 
acters into his plays, and even of making his heroes 
philosophers; but when they come on the stage they 
have no philosophy to expound: they are only pessi- 
mists and railers; and their occasional would-be philo- 
sophic speeches, such as The Seven Ages of Man and 
The Soliloquy on Suicide, shew how deeply in the dark 
Shakespear was as to what philosophy means. He 
forced himself in among the greatest of playwrights 
without having once entered that region in which 
Michael Angelo, Beethoven, Goethe, and the antique 
Athenian stage poets are great. He would really not be 
great at all if it were not that he had religion enough to 
be aware that his religionless condition was one of 
despair. His greatest work, Lear, would be only a 


Xevl Back to Methuselah 


melodrama were it not for its express admission that if 
there is nothing more to be said of the universe than 
Hamlet has to say, then “as flies to wanton boys so we 
are to the gods: they kill us for their sport.” 

Ever since Shakespear, playwrights have been strug- 
gling with the same lack of religion; and many of them 
were forced to become mere panders and sensation- 
mongers because, though they had higher ambitions, 
they could find no better subject matter. From Con- 
greve to Sheridan they were so sterile in spite of their 
wit that they did not achieve between them the output of 
Moliére’s single lifetime; and they were all (not without 
reason) ashamed of their profession, and preferred to 
be regarded as mere men of fashion with a rakish hobby. 
Goldsmith’s was the only saved soul in that pandemonium. 

The leaders among my own contemporaries (now 
veterans) snatched at minor social problems rather than 
write entirely without any wider purpose than to win 
money and fame. One of them expressed to me his envy 
of the ancient Greek playwrights because the Athenians 
asked them, not for some “new and original” disguise 
of the half-dozen threadbare plots of the modern theatre, 
but for the deepest lesson they could draw from the 
familiar and sacred legends of their country. “Let us 
all,’ he said, “‘write an Electra, an Antigone, an 
Agamemnon, and shew what we can do with it.” But 
he did not write any of them, because these legends are 
no longer religious: Aphrodite and Artemis and Poseidon 
are deader than their statues. Another, with a com- 
manding position and every trick of British farce and 
Parisian drama at his fingers’ ends, finally could not 
write without a sermon to preach, and yet could not find 
texts more fundamental than the hypocrisies of sham 
Puritanism, or the matrimonial speculation which makes 
our young actresses as careful of their reputations as of 


Back to Methuselah xevli 


their complexions. A third, too tender-hearted, to break 
our spirits with the realities of a bitter experience, 
coaxed a wistful pathos and a dainty fun out of the 
fairy cloudland that lay between him and the empty 
heavens. The giants of the theatre of our time, Ibsen 
and Strindberg, had no greater comfort for the world 
than we: indeed much less; for they refused us even the 
Shakespearian-Dickensian consolation of laughter at 
mischief, accurately called comic relief. Our emanci- 
pated young successors scorn us, very properly. But 
they will be able to do no better whilst the drama remains 
pre-Evolutionist. Let them consider the great exception 
of Goethe. He, no richer than Shakespear, Ibsen, or 
Strindberg in specific talent as a playwright, is in the 
empyrean whilst they are gnashing their teeth in im- 
potent fury in the mud, or at best finding an acid enjoy- 
ment in the irony of their predicament. Goethe is 
Olympian: the other giants are infernal in everything 
but their veracity and their repudiation of the irreligion 
of their time: that is, they are bitter and hopeless. It 
is not a question of mere dates. Goethe was an 
Evolutionist in 1830: many playwrights, even young 
ones, are still untouched by Creative Evolution in 1920. 
Ibsen was Darwinized to the extent of exploiting 
heredity on the stage much as the ancient Athenian play- 
wrights exploited the Eumenides; but there is no trace 
in his plays of any faith in or knowledge of Creative 
Evolution as a modern scientific fact, though the poetic 
aspiration is plain enough in his Emperor or Galilean; 
and as it is one of Ibsen’s great distinctions that nothing 
was valid for him but science, he left that vision of the 
future which his Roman seer calls “the third Empire” 
behind him as a Utopian dream when he settled down to 
his ,serious grapple with realities in those plays of 
modern life with which he overcame Europe and broke 


XCVIil Back to Methuselah 


the dusty windows of every dry-rotten theatre in it from 
Moscow to Manchester. 


My Own Part in the Matter 


In my own activities as a playwright I found this state 
of things intolerable. The fashionable theatre pre- 
scribed one serious subject: clandestine adultery: the 
dullest of all subjects for a serious author, whatever it 
may be for audiences who read the police intelligence 
and skip the reviews and leading articles. I tried slum- 
landlordism, doctrinaire Free Love (pseudo-Ibsenism), 
prostitution, militarism, marriage, history, current 
politics, natural Christianity, national and individual 
character, paradoxes of conventional society, husband- 
hunting, questions of conscience, professional delusions 
and impostures, all worked into a series of comedies of 
manners in the classic fashion, which was then very 
much out of fashion, the mechanical tricks of Parisian 
“construction” being de rigueur in the theatre. But 
this, though it occupied me and established me profes- 
sionally, did not constitute me an iconographer of the 
religion of my time, and thus fulfil my natural function 
as an artist. I was quite conscious of this; for I had 
always known that civilization needs a religion as a 
matter of life or death; and as the conception of 
Creative Evolution developed I saw that we were at last 
within reach of a faith which complied with the first 
‘condition of all the religions that have ever taken hold 
of humanity: namely, that it must be, first and funda- 
mentally, a science of metabiology. This was a crucial 
point with me; for I had seen Bible fetichism, after 
standing up to all the rationalistic batteries of Hume, 
Voltaire, and the rest, collapse before the onslaught of 
much less gifted Evolutionists, solely because they dis- 


Back to Methuselah XCix 


credited it as a biological document; so that from that 
moment it lost its hold, and left literate Christendom 
faithless. My own Irish eighteenth-centuryism made it 
impossible for me to believe anything until I could con- 
ceive it as a scientific hypothesis, even though the 
abominations, quackeries, impostures, venalities, creduli- 
ties, and delusions of the camp followers of science, and 
the brazen hes and priestly pretensions of the pseudo- 
scientific cure-mongers, all sedulously inculcated by 
modern “‘secondary education,”’ were so monstrous that 
I was sometimes forced to make a verbal distinction be- 
tween science and knowledge lest I should mislead my 
readers. But I never forgot that without knowledge 
even wisdom is more dangerous than mere opportunist 
ignorance, and that somebody must take the Garden of 
Eden in hand and weed it properly. a 
Accordingly, in 1901, I took the legend of Don Juan 
in its Mozartian form and made it a dramatic parable of 
Creative Evolution. But being then at the height of 
my invention and comedic talent, I decorated it too bril- 
liantly and lavishly. I surrounded it with a comedy of 
which it formed only one act, and that act was so com- 
pletely episodical (it was a dream which did not affect 
the action of the piece) that the comedy could be de- 
tached and played by itself: indeed it could hardly be 
played at full length owing to the enormous length of 
the entire work, though that feat has been performed a 
few times in Scotland by Mr. Esmé Percy, who led one 
of the forlorn hopes of the advanced drama at that time. 
Also I supplied the published work with an imposing 
framework consisting of a preface, an appendix called 
The Revolutionist’s Handbook, and a final display of 
aphoristic fireworks. The effect was so vertiginous, 
apparently, that nobody noticed the new religion in the 
centre of the intellectual whirlpool. Now I protest I 


c Back to Methuselah 


did not cut these cerebral capers in mere inconsiderate 
exuberance. I did it because the worst convention of 
the criticism of the theatre current at that time was that 
intellectual seriousness is out of place on the stage; 
that the theatre is a place of shallow amusement; that 
people go there to be soothed after the enormous intel- 
lectual strain of a day in the city: in short, that a 
playwright is a person whose business it is to make 
unwholesome confectionery out of cheap emotions. My 
answer to this was to put all my intellectual goods in 
the shop window under the sign of Man and Superman. 
That part of my design succeeded. By good luck and 
acting, the comedy triumphed on the stage; and the 
book was a good deal discussed. Since then the sweet- 
shop view of the theatre has been out of countenance; 
and its critical exponents have been driven to take an 
intellectual pose which, though often more trying than 
their old intellectually nihilistic vulgarity, at least con- 
cedes the dignity of the theatre, not to mention the use- 
fulness of those who live by criticizing it. And the 
younger playwrights are not only taking their art 
seriously, but being taken seriously themselves. The 
critic who ought to be a newsboy is now comparatively 
rare, 

I now find myself inspired to make a second legend of 
Creative Evolution without distractions and embellish- 
ments. My sands are running out; the exuberance of 
1901 has aged into the garrulity of 1920; and the war 
has been a stern intimation that the matter is not one to 
be trifled with. I abandon the legend of Don Juan with 
its erotic associations, and go back to the legend of the 
Garden of Eden. I exploit the eternal interest of the 
philosopher’s stone which enables men to live for ever. 
I am not, I hope, under more illusion than is humanly 
tnevitable as to the crudity of this my beginning of a 


Back to Methuselah Cl 


Bible for Creative Evolution, I am doing the best I can 
at’ my age. My powers are waning; but so much the 
better for those who found me unbearably brilliant 
when I was in my prime. It is my hope that a hundred 
apter and more elegant parables by younger hands ‘will 
soon leave mine as far behind as the religious pictures 
of the fifteenth century left behind the first attempts of 
the early Christians at iconography. In that hope I 
withdraw and ring up the curtain.

XXXIT 


IN THE BEGINNING 
ACT I 


The Garden of Eden. Afternoon. An immense 
serpent ts sleeping with her head buried in a thick bed of 
Johnswort, and her body coiled in apparently endless 
rings through the branches of a tree, which is already 
well grown; for the days of creation have been longer 
than our reckoning. She is not yet visible to anyone 
unaware of her presence, as her colors of green and 
brown make a perfect camouflage. Near her head a low 
rock shews above the Johnswort. 

The rock and tree are on the border of a glade in 
which lies a dead fawn all awry, its neck being broken. 
Adam, crouching with one hand on the rock, is staring 
én consternation at the dead body. He has not noticed 
the serpent on his left hand. He turns his face to has 
right and calls excitedly. 


ADAM. Eve! Eve! 

EVE’s voIcE. What is it, Adam? 

apam. Come here. Quick. Something has happened. 

EVE [running in] What? Where? [Adam points to 
the fawn.] Oh! [She goes to it; and he is emboldened 
to go with her.| What is the matter with its eyes? 

apam. It is not only its eyes. Look. [He kicks it.] 

zve. Ohdont! Why doesnt it wake? 

apam. I dont know. It is not asleep. 

EvE. Not asleep? 

ADAM. ‘Try.

EVE [trying to shake it and roll it over] It is stiff and 
cold. 

avam. Nothing will wake it. 

eve. It has a queer smell. Pah! [She dusts her 
hands, and draws away from it. | Did you find it like 
that? 

apam. No. It was playing about; and it tripped 
and went head over heels. It never stirred again. Its 
neck is wrong. [He stoops to lift the neck and shew 
her. | 

Eve. Dont touch it. Come away from it. 

[They both retreat, and contemplate it from a few 
steps’ distance with growing repulsion. | 

EvE. Adam. 

ADAM. Yes? 

EvE. Suppose you were to trip and fall, would you 
go like that? 

apam. Ugh! [He shudders and sits down on the 
rock. | 

EVE [throwing herself on the ground beside him, and 
grasping his knee| You must be careful. Promise me 
you will be careful. 

apaM. What is the good of being careful? We have 
to live here for ever. Think of what for ever means! 
Sooner or later I shall trip and fall. It may be tomor- 
row; it may be after as many days as there are leaves in 
the garden and grains of sand by the river. No matter: 
some day I shall forget and stumble. 

EVE. I too. 

avam [horrified] Oh no, no. I should be alone. 
Alone for ever. You must never put yourself in danger 
of stumbling. You must not move about. You must 
sit still. I will take care of you and bring you what you 
want, 

EVE [turning away from him with a shrug, and hug-

ging her ankles] I should soon get tired of that. Be- | 

sides, if it happened to you, J should be alone. I could 

not sit still then. And at last it would happen to me too. 
apamM. And then? 

EvE. Then we should be no more. There would be 
only the things on all fours, and the birds, and the 
snakes. 

apamM. That must not be. 

EVE. Yes: that must not be. But it might be. 

apam. No. [I tell you it must not be. I know that 
it must not be. 

EvE. We both know it. How do we know it? 

ADAM. ‘There is a voice in the garden that tells me 
things. 

EVE. The garden is full of voices sometimes. They 
put all sorts of thoughts into my head. 

apam. ‘Tome there is only one voice. It is very low; 
but it is so near that it is like a whisper from within my- 
self. There is no mistaking it for any voice of the birds 
or beasts, or for your voice. 

Eve. It is strange that I should hear voices from all 
sides and you only one from within. But I have some 
thoughts that come from within me and not from the 
‘voices. The thought that we must not cease to be comes 
from within. 

apam [despairingly] But we shall cease to be. We 
shall fall like the fawn and be broken. [Rising and 
moving about in his agitation I cannot bear this knowl- 
edge. I will not have it. It must not be, I tell you. 
Yet I do not know how to prevent it. 

eve. That is just what I feel; but it is very strange 
that you should say so: there is no pleasing you. You 
change your mind so often. 

apam [scolding her] Why do you say that? How 
have I changed my mind?

Eve. You say we must not cease to exist. But you 
used to complain of having to exist always and for ever. 
You sometimes sit for hours brooding and silent, hating 
me in your heart. When I ask you what I have done to 
you, you say you are not thinking of me, but of the 
horror of having to be here for ever. But I know very 
well that what you mean is the horror of having to be 
here with me for ever. 

apamM. Oh! That is what you think, is itP Well, 
you are wrong. [He sits down again, sulkily.|] It is 
the horror of having to be with myself for ever. I like 
you; but I do not like myself. I want to be different; 
to be better; to begin again and again; to shed myself 
as a snake sheds its skin. I am tired of myself. And 
yet I must endure myself, not for a day or for many 
days, but for ever. That is a dreadful thought. That 
is what makes me sit brooding and silent and hateful. 
Do you never think of that? 

EvE. No: I do not think about myself: what is the 
use? I am what I am: nothing can alter that. J think 
about you. 

apaM. You should not. You are always spying on 
me. JI can never be alone. You always want to know 
what I have been doing. It is a burden. You should 
try to have an existence of your own, instead of occupy- 
ing yourself with my existence. 

Eve. I have to think about you. You are lazy: you 
are dirty: you neglect yourself: you are always dream- 
ing: you would eat bad food and become disgusting if I 
did not watch you and occupy myself with you. And 
now some day, in spite of all my care, you will fall on 
your head: and become dead. 

ADAM. Dead? What word is that? 

EVE [pointing to the fawn] Like that. I call it dead. 


dict L in the Begmning 5 


ADAM [rising and approaching it slowly] There is 
something uncanny about it. 

EVE [joining him] Oh! It is changing into little 
white worms. 

ADAM. Throw it into the river. It is unbearable. 

EVE. I dare not touch it. 

apam. Then I must, though I loathe it. It is 
poisoning the air. [He gathers its hooves in his hand 
and carries tt away in the direction from which Eve 
came, holding tt as far from him as possible. | 

| Eve looks after them for a moment; then, with a 
shiver of disgust, sits down on the rock, brooding. The 
body of the serpent becomes visible, glowing with won- 
derful new colors. She rears her head slowly from the 
bed of Johnswort, and speaks into Eve's ear in a strange 
seductively musical whisper. | 

THE SERPENT. Live. 

EVE | startled | Who is that? 

THE SERPENT. Itis I. I have come to shew you my 
beautiful new hood. See [she spreads a magnificent 
amethystine hood}! 

EVE [admiring it] Oh! But who taught you to 
speak? ; 

THE SERPENT. You and Adam. I have crept through 
the grass, and hidden, and listened to you. 

Eve. That was wonderfully clever of you. 

THE SERPENT. I am the most subtle of all the crea- 
tures of the field. 

evg. Your hood is most lovely. [She strokes it and 
pets the serpent.| Pretty thing! Do you love your 
godmother Eve? 

THE SERPENT. I adore her. [She licks Eve’s neck 
with her double tongue. | 

eve [petting her] Eve’s wonderful darling snake 


0 AH Wie DCP UWI Carus 


Eve will never be lonely now that her snake can talk to 
her. 

THE snake. IT can talk of many things. I am very 
wise. It was I who whispered the word to you that you 
did not know. Dead. Death. Die. 

EVE [shuddering | Why do you remind me of it? I 
forgot it when I saw your beautiful hood. You must 
not remind me of unhappy things. 

THE SERPENT. Death is not an unhappy thing when 
you have learnt how to conquer it. 

EVE. How can I conquer.it? 

THE SERPENT. By another thing, called birth. 

eve. What? [Trying to pronounce it] B-birth? 

THE SERPENT. Yes, birth. 

gEvE. What is birth? 

THE SERPENT. The serpent never dies. Some day 
you shall see me come out of this beautiful skin, a new 
snake with a new and lovelier skin. That is birth. 

EVE. ‘J have seen that. It is wonderful. 

THE SERPENT. If I can do that, what can I not do? 
T tell you I am very subtle. When you and Adam talk, 
I hear you say “Why?” Always “Why?” You see 
things; and you say “Why?” But I dream things that 
never were; and I say “Why not?” I made the word 
dead to describe my old skin that I cast when I am re- 
newed. I call that renewal being born. 

EVE. Born is a beautiful word. 

THE SERPENT. Why not be born again and again as 
I am, new and beautiful every time? 

gevE. I! It does not happen: that is why. 

THE SERPENT. That is how; but it isnot why. Why 
not? 

gvE. But I should not like it. It would be nice to be 
new again; but my old skin would lie on the ground 


Act 1 in the Beginning 7 


fone just like me; and Adam would see it shrivel up 
and— 

THE SERPENT. No. He need not. There is a second 
birth 

Eve. A second birth? . 

THE SERPENT. Listen. I will tell you a great secret. 
I am very subtle; and I have thought and thought and 
thought. And I am very wilful, and must have what 
I want; and I have willed and willed and willed. And 
I have eaten strange things: stones and apples that you 
are afraid to eat. 

EVE. You dared. 

THE SERPENT. I dared everything. And at last I 
found a way of gathering together a part of the life in 
my body— 

Eve. What is the life? 

THE SERPENT. That which makes the difference be- 
tween the dead fawn and the live one. . 

EVE. What a beautiful word! And what a wonder- 
ful thing! Life is the loveliest of all the new words. 

THE SERPENT. Yes: it was by meditating on Life 
that I gained the power to do miracles. 

EVE. Mhracles? Another new word. 

THE SERPENT. A miracle is an impossible thing that 
is nevertheless possible. Something that never could 
happen, and yet does happen. 

EVE. ‘Tell me some miracle that you have done. 

THE SERPENT. I gathered a part of the life in my 
body, and shut it into a tiny white case made of the 
stones I had eaten. 

Eve. And what good was that? 

THE SERPENT. I shewed the little case to the sun, and 
left it in its warmth. And it burst; and a little snake 
came out; and it became bigger and bigger from day to 
day until it was as big as I. That was the second birth.

o in the beginning raruL 


gve. Oh! That is too wonderful. It stirs inside 
me. It hurts. 

THE SERPENT. It nearly tore me asunder. Yet I am 
alive, and can burst my skin and renew myself as before. 
Soon there will be as many snakes in Eden as there are 
scales on my body. Then death will not matter: this, 
snake and that snake will die; but the snakes will live. 

eve. But the rest of us will die sooner or later, like 
the fawn. And then there-will be nothing but snakes, 
snakes, snakes everywhere. 

THE SERPENT. That must not be. I worship you, 
Eve. I must have something to worship. Something 
quite different to myself, like you. There must be some- 
thing greater than the snake. 

eve. Yes: it must not be. Adam must not perish. 


You are very subtle: tell me what to do. 


THE SERPENT. Think. Will. Eat the dust. Lick 


_ the white stone: bite the apple you dread. ‘The sun will 


give life. 

eve. I donot trust the sun. I will give life myself. 
I will tear another Adam from my body if I tear my 
body to pieces in the act. 

THE SERPENT. Do. Dare it. Everything is pos- 
sible: everything. Listen. I am old. I am the old 
serpent, older than Adam, older than Eve. I remember 


| Lilith, who came before Adam and Eve. I was her 


darling as I am yours. She was alone: there was no 
man with her. She saw death as you saw it when the 
fawn fell; and she knew then that she must find out how 
to renew herself and cast the skin like me. She had a 
mighty will: she strove and strove and willed and willed 
for more moons than there are leaves on all the trees of 
the garden. Her pangs were terrible: her groans drove 
sleep from Eden. She said it must never be again: that 
the burden of renewing life was past bearing: that it 


Act I In the Beginning 9 


was too much for one. And when she cast the skin, lo! 
there was not one new Lilith but two: one like herself, 
oe other like Adam. You were the one: Adam was the 
other. 

EVE. But why did she divide into two, and make us 
different ? 

THE SERPENT. I tell you the labor is too much for 
one. ‘T'wo must share it. 

Eve. Do you mean that Adam must share it with 
me? He will not. He cannot bear pain, nor take trouble 
with his body. 

THE SERPENT. He need not. There will be no pain 
for him. He will implore you to let him do his share. 
He will be in your power through his desire. 

EVE. Then I will doit. But how? How did Lilith 
work this miracle? 

THE SERPENT. She imagined it. 

EVE. What is imagined? 

THE SERPENT. She told it to me as a mervellous 
story of something that never happened to a Lilith that 
never was. She did not know then that imagination is 
the beginning of creation. You imagine what you de- 
sire; you will what you imagine; and at last you create 
what you will. 

EVE. How can I create out of nothing? 

THE SERPENT. Everything must have been created 
out of nothing. Look at that thick roll of hard flesh 
on your strong arm! That was not always there: you 
could not climb a tree when I first saw you. But you 
willed and tried and willed and tried; and your will 
created out of nothing the roll on your arm until you 
had your desire, and could draw yourself up with one 
hand and seat yourself on the bough that was above 
your head. 

EVE. That was practice. 


10 In the Beginning Part I 


THE SERPENT. Things wear out by practice: they 
do not grow by it. Your hair streams in the wind as if 
it were trying to stretch itself further and further. But 
it does not grow longer for all its practice in streaming, 
because you have not willed it so. When Lilith told me 
what she had imagined in our silent language (for there 
were no words then) I bade her desire it and will it; and 
then, to our great wonder, the thing she had desired 
and willed created itself in her under the urging of her 
will, Then I too willed to renew myself as two instead 
of one; and after many days the miracle happened, and 
I burst from my skin with another snake interlaced with 
me; and now there are two imaginations, two desires, 
two wills to create with. 

EvE. ‘To desire, to imagine, to will, to create. That 
is too long a story. Find me one word for it all: you, 
who are so clever at words. 

THE SERPENT. In one word, to conceive. That is the 
word that means both the beginning i In imagination and 
the end in creation. 

EvE. Find me a word for the story Lilith imagined 
and told you in your silent language: the story that was 
too wonderful to be true, and yet came true. 

THE SERPENT. A poem. 

Eve. Find me another word for what Lilith was to 
me. 

THE SERPENT. She was your mother. 

EVE. And Adam’s mother? 

THE SERPENT. Yes. 

EVE | about to rise] I will go and tell Adam to con- 
eelve. 

THE SERPENT [laughs|!!! 

EVE [jarred and startled] What a hateful noise! 
What is the matter with you? No one has ever uttered 
such a sound before. 


Act I In the Beginning 11 


THE SERPENT. Adam cannot conceive. 

EVE. Why? 

THE SERPENT. Lilith did not imagine him so. He 
can imagine: he can will: he can desire: he can gather 
his life together for a great spring towards creation: 
he can create all things except one; and that one is his 
own kind. 

EVE. Why did Lilith keep this from him? 

THE SERPENT. Because if he could do that he could 
do without Eve. 

EVE Thatis true. It is I who must conceive. 

THE SERPENT. Yes. By that he is tied to you. 

EvE. And I to him! 

THE SERPENT. Yes, until you create another Adam. 

eve. I had not thought of that. You are very 
subtle. But if I create another Eve he may turn to her 
and do without me. I will not create any Eves, only 
Adams. 

THE SERPENT. They cannot renew themselves with- 
out Eves. Sooner or later you will die like the fawn; 
and the new Adams will be unable to create without new 
Eves. You can imagine such an end; but you cannot 
desire it, therefore cannot will it, therefore cannot create 
Adams only. 

EVE. If I am to die like the fawn, why should not 
the rest die too? What do I care? 

THE SERPENT. Life must not cease. That comes 
before everything. It is silly to say you do not care. 
You do care. It is that care that will prompt your 
imagination; inflame your desires; make your will irre- 
sistible; and create out of nothing. 

EvE [thoughtfully] There can be no such thing as 
nothing. The garden is full, not empty. 

THE SERPENT. I had not thought of that. That is 
a great thought. Yes: there is no such thing as nothing, 


12 Jn the Beginning Part 1 


only things we cannot see. The chameleon eats the 
air. 

eve. Ihave another thought: I must tell it to Adam. 
[Calling] Adam! Adam! Coo-ee! 

ADAM’s VOICE. Coo-ee! 

EVE, This will please him, and cure his fits of melan- 
choly. 

THE SERPENT. Do not tell him yet. I have not told 
you the great secret. 

Eve. What more is there to tell? It is I who have 
to do the miracle. 

THE SERPENT. No: he, too, must desire and will. 
But he must give his desire and his will to you. 

EVE. How? 

THE SERPENT. That is the great secret. Hush! he 
1s coming. 

apa [returning] Is there another voice in the garden 
besides our voices and the Voice? I heard a new voice. 

EvE [rising and running to him] Only think, Adam! 
Our snake has learnt to speak by listening to us. 

apaM [delighted| Is it so? [He goes past her to the 
stone, and fondles the serpent. | 

THE SERPENT [responding affectionately| It is so, 
dear Adam. 

Eve. But I have more wonderful news than that. 
Adam: we need not live for ever. 

apam [dropping the snake’s head im his excitement] 
What! Eve: do not play with me about this. If only 
there may he an end some day, and yet no end! If only 
I can be relieved of the horror of having to endure my- 
self for ever! If only the care of this terrible garden 
may pass on to some other gardener! If only the sen- 
tinel set by the Voice can be relieved! If only the rest 
and sleep that enable me to bear it from day to day 
could grow after many days into an eternal rest, an 


Act I In the Beginning 13 


eternal sleep, then I could face my days, however long 
they may last. Only, there must be some end, some 
end: I am not strong enough to bear eternity. 

THE SERPENT. You need not live to see another sum- 
mer; and yet there shall be no end. 

ADAM. That cannot be. 

THE SERPENT. It can be. 

EVE. It shall be. 

THE SERPENT. It is. Kill me; and you will find 
another snake in the garden tomorrow. You will find 
more snakes than there are fingers on your hands, 

EVE. I will make other Adams, other Eves. 

ADAM. I tell you you must not make up stories about 
this. It cannot happen. 

THE SERPENT. I can remember when you were your- 
self a thing that could not happen. Yet you are. 

avaM [struck] That must be true. [He sits down on 
the stone. | 

THE SERPENT. I will tell Eve the secret; and she will 
tell it to you. 

apaM. The secret! [He turns quickly towards the 
serpent, and m doing so puts his foot on something 
sharp.] Oh! 

EVE. What is it? 

apaM [rubbing his foot] A thistle. And there, next 
to it, a briar. And nettles, too! I am tired of pulling 
these things up to keep the garden pleasant for us for 
ever, 

THE SERPENT. ‘They do not grow very fast. They 
will not overrun the whole garden for a long time: not 
until you have laid down your burden and gone to sleep 
for ever. Why should you trouble yourself? Let the 
new Adams clear a place for themselves. 

ApaM. That is very true. You must tell us your 


14 Jn the Beginning Part 1 


secret. You see, Eve, what a splendid thing it is not to 
have to live for ever. 

EvE [throwing herself down discontentedly and pluck- 
ing at the grass] That is so like a man. The moment 
you find we need not last for ever, you talk as 1f we were 
going toend today. You must clear away some of those 
horrid things, or we shall be scratched and stung when- 
ever we forget to look where we are stepping. 

ADAM. Oh yes, some of them, of course. But only 
some. I will clear them away tomorrow. 

THE SERPENT [laughs|!!! 

apaM. That is a funny noise to make. [I like it. 

EVE. I donot. Why do you make it again? 

THE SERPENT. ‘Adam has invented something new. 
He has invented tomorrow. You will invent things every 
day now that the burden of immortality is lifted from 
you. 

EVE. Immortality? What is that? 

THE SERPENT. My new word for having to live for 
ever. 

EvE. The serpent has made a beautiful word for 
being. Living. 

apaAM. Make me a beautiful word for doing things 
tomorrow; for that surely is a great and blessed 
mvention, 

THE SERPENT. Procrastination. 

EvE. That is a sweet word. I wish I had a serpent’s 
tongue. 

THE SERPENT. ‘That may come too. Everything is 
possible. 

AvAM [springing up in sudden terror] Oh! 

EVE. What is the matter now? 

ApAM. My rest! My escape from life. 

THE SERPENT. Death. That is the word, 


Act I In the Beginning 15 


E apaM. There is a terrible danger in this procrastina- 
ion. 

EVE. What danger? 

apam. If I put off death until tomorrow, I shall 
never die. ‘There is no such day as tomorrow, and never 
can be, 

THE SERPENT. I am very subtle; but Man is deeper 
in his thought than I am. The woman knows that there 
is no such thing as nothing: the man knows that there 
is no such day as tomorrow. I do well to worship them. 

apaM. If I am to undertake death, I must appoint 
a real day, not a tomorrow. When shall I die. 

EVE. You may die when I have made another Adam. 
Not before. But then, as soon as you like. [She rises, 
and passing behind him, strolls off carelessly to the tree 
and leans against it, stroking a ring of the snake. } 

ADAM. ‘There need be no hurry even then. 

EVE. I see you will put it off until tomorrow. 

apam. And you? Will you die the moment you have 
made a new Eve? 

EvE. Why should I? Are you eager to be rid of 
me? Only just now you wanted me to sit still and never 
move lest I should stumble and die like the fawn. Now 
you no longer care. 

ADAM. It does not matter so much now. 

evE [angrily to the snake} This death that you have 
brought into the garden is an evil thing. He wants me 
to die. 

THE SERPENT [to Adam] Do you want her to die? 

apam. No. It is I who am to die. Eve must not 
die before me. I should be lonely. 

EvE. You could get one of the new Eves. 

apam. That is true. But they might not be quite 
the same. They could not: I feel sure of that. They 


16 In the Beginning Part I 


would not have the same memories. They would be—I 
want a word for them. 

THE SERPENT. Strangers. 

apam. Yes: that is a good hard word. Strangers. 

EVE. When there are new Adams and Eves we shall 
live in a garden of strangers. We shall need each other. 
[She comes quickly behind him and turns up his face to 
her.] Do not forget that, Adam. Never forget it. 

apam. Why should I forget it? It is I who have 
thought of it. 

EvE. I, too, have thought of something. The fawn 
stumbled and fell and died. But you could come softly 
up behind me and [she suddenly pounces on his shoulders 
and throws him forward on his face| throw me down so 
that I should die. I should not dare to sleep if there 
were no reason why you should not make me die. 

apam [scrambling up im horror] Make you die!!! 
What a frightful thought! 

THE SERPENT. Kill, kill, kill, kill. That is the word. 

EvE. The new Adams and Eves might kill us. I 
shall not make them. [She sits on the rock and pulls 
him down beside her, clasping him to her with her right 
arm. | 

THE SERPENT. You must. For if you do not there 
will be an end. 

apaM. No: they will not kill us: they will feel as I 
do. There is something against it. The Voice in the 
garden will tell them that they must not kill, as it tells 
me. 

THE SERPENT. ‘The voice in the garden is your own 
voice. 

apaM. It is; and it is not. It is something greater 
than me: I am only a part of it. 

gve. The Voice does not tell me not to kill you. Yet 


Act I In the Beginning 17, 


I do not want you to die before me. No voice is needed 
to make me feel that. 

ApaM [throwing his arm round her shoulder with an 
expression of anguish] Oh no: that is plain without any 
voice. There is something that holds us together, some- 
thing that has no word— 

THE SERPENT. Love. Love. Love. 

apAM. That is too short a word for so long a thing. 

THE SERPENT [laughs|! ! ! 

EVE [turning impatiently to the snake| That heart- 
biting sound again! Do not do it. Why do you do it? 

THE SERPENT. Love may be too long a word for so 
short a thing soon. But when it is short it will be very 
sweet. 

avam [ruminating] You puzzle me. My old trouble 
was heavy; but it was simple. These wonders that you 
promise to do may tangle up my being before they bring 
me the gift of death. I was troubled with the burden 
of eterna] being; but I was not confused in my mind. 
If I did not know that I loved Eve, at least I did not 
know that she might cease to love me, and come to love 
some other Adam and desire my death. Can you find a 
name for that knowledge? 

THE SERPENT. Jealousy. Jealousy. Jealousy. 

apaM. A hideous word. 

EVE [shaking him] Adam: you must not brood. You 
think too much. 

apam [angrily] How can I help brooding when the 
future has become uncertain? Anything is better than 
uncertainty. Life has become uncertain. Love is un- 
certain. Have you a word for this new misery? 

THE SERPENT. Fear. Fear. Fear. 

apam. Have you a remedy for it? 

THE SERPENT. Yes. Hope. Hope. Hope. 

apam. What is hope? 


18 In the Beginning Part I 


THE sERPENT. As long as you do not know the 
future you do not know that it will not be happier than 
the past. That is hope. 

AapaM. It does not console me. Fear is stronger in 
me than hope. I must have certainty. [He rises threat- 
eningly.| Give it to me; or I will kill you when next I 
catch you asleep. 

EVE [throwing her arms round the serpent | My beau- 
tiful snake. Oh no. How can you even think such a 
horror? 

ADAM. Fear will drive me to anything. The serpent 
gave me fear. Let it now give me certainty or go in 
fear of me. 

THE SERPENT. Bind the future by your will. Make 
a VOW. 

spam. What is a vow? 

THE SERPENT. Choose a day for your death; and 
resolve to die on that day. Then death is no longer 
uncertain but certain. Let Eve vow to love you until 
your death. Then love will be no longer uncertain. 

ApaM. Yes: that is splendid: that will bind the 
future. 

EVE | displeased, turning away from the serpent | But 
it will destroy hope. 

apam [angrily] Be silent, woman. Hope is wicked. 
Happiness is wicked. Certainty is blessed. 

THE SERPENT. What is wicked? You have invented 
a word. 

ADAM. Whatever I fear to do is wicked. Listen to 
me, Eve; and you, snake, listen too, that your memory 
may hold my vow. I will live a thousand sets of the four 
seasons— 

THE SERPENT. Years. Years. 

apam. I will live a thousand years; and then I will 


“AUL 1 Au Wie Deyn LY 


endure no more: I will die and take my rest. And I will 
love Eve all that time and no other woman. 

EvE. And if Adam keeps his vow I will love no other 
man until he dies, 

THE SERPENT. You have both invented marriage, 
And what he will be to you and not to any other woman 
is husband; and what you will be to him and not to any 
other man is wife. 

apam [instinctively moving his hand towards her} 
Husband and wife. 

EVE | slipping her hand into his] Wife and husband. 

THE SERPENT [laughs]! ! ! 

. Eve [snatching herself loose from Adam] Do not 
make that odious noise, I tell you. 

ADAM. Do not listen to her: the noise is good: it 
lightens my heart. You are a jolly snake. But you 
have not made a vow yet. What vow do you make? 

THE SERPENT. I make no vows. I take my chance. 

apam. Chance? What does that mean? 

THE SERPENT. It means that I fear certainty as you 
fear uncertainty. It means that nothing is certain but 
uncertainty. If I bind the future I bind my will. If I 
bind my will I strangle creation. 

EVE. Creation must not be strangled. I tell you I 
will create, though I tear myself to pieces in the act. 

apam. Be silent, both of you. I will bind the future. 
I will be delivered from fear. |T'o0 Eve] We have made 
our vows; and if you will create, you shall create within 
the bounds of those vows. You shall not listen to that 
snake any more. Come [he seizes her by the hair to drag 
her away]. 

EvE. Let me go, you fool. It has not yet told me 
the secret. 

apam [releasing her| That is true. What is a fool? 

Eve. I do not know: the word came to me. It was 


20 In the Beginning Part I 


what you are when you forget and brood and are filled 
with fear. Let us listen to the snake, 

apam. No: I am afraid of it. I feel as if the 
ground were giving way under my feet when it speaks, 
Do you stay and listen to it. 

THE SERPENT [laughs]!!! 

apam [brightenmg| That noise takes away fear. 
Funny. The snake and the woman are going to whisper 
secrets. [He chuckles and goes away slowly, laughing: 
his first laugh. | 

EvE. Now the secret. The secret. [She sits on the 
rock and throws her arms round the serpent, who begins 
whispering to her. | 

[Eve's face lights up with intense interest, which 
mereases until an expression of overwhelming repug- 
nance takes tts place. She buries her face in her hands. | 


ACT fI 


A few centuries later. Morning. An oasis in Mesopo- 
tamta. Close at hand the end of a log house abuts on 
a kitchen garden. Adam is digging in the middle of the 
garden. On his right, Eve sits on a stool in the shadow 
of a tree by the doorway, spinning flaz. Her wheel, 
which she turns by hand, is a large disc of heavy wood, 
practically a fly-wheel. At the opposite side of the 
garden is a thorn brake with a passage right through it 
barred by a hurdle. 

The two are scantily and carelessly dressed in rough 
linen and leaves. They have lost their youth and grace; 
and Adam has an unkept beard and jaggedly cut hair; 
but they are strong and im the prime of life. Adam 
looks worried, like a farmer. Eve, better humored (hav- 
ing given up worrying ), sits and spins and thinks. 

A MAN’s voice. Hallo, mother! 

EvE [looking across the garden towards the hurdle] 
Here is Cain. 

apa [uttering a grunt of disgust]!!! [He goes on 
digging without raising his head. | 

[Cain kicks the hurdle out of his way, and strides into 
the garden. In pose, voice, and dress he is insistently war- 
like. He is equipped with huge spear and broad brass- 
bound leather shield; his casque is a tiger’s head with 
bull’s horns; he wears a scarlet cloak with gold brooch 
over a lion’s skin with the claws dangling; his feet are 
in sandals with brass ornaments; his shins are in brass

greaves; and his bristling military moustache glistens 
with oil. To his parents he has the self-assertvve, not- 
quite-at-ease manner of a revolted son who knows that he 
is not forgiven nor approved of. | 

cain [fo Adam] Still digging? Always dig, dig, dig. 
Sticking in the old furrow. No progress! no advanced 
ideas! no adventures! What should I be if I had stuck 
to the digging you taught me? 

apaM. What are you now, with your shield and 
spear, and your brother’s blood crying from the ground 
against you? 

cain. I am the first murderer: you are only the first 
man. Anybody could be the first man: it is as easy as 
to be the first cabbage. ‘To be the first murderer one 
must be a man of spirit. 

apAM. Begone. Leave us in peace. The world is 
wide enough to keep us apart. 

EvE. Why do you want to drive him away? He is 
mine. JI made him out of my own body. I want to see 
my work sometimes. 

avamM. You made Abel also, He killed Abel. Can 
you bear to look at him after that? 

carn. Whose fault was it that I killed Abel? Who 
invented killing? Did I? No: he invented it himself. 
I followed your teaching. I dug and dug and dug. 
T cleared away the thistles and briars. I ate the fruits 
of the earth. TI lived in the sweat of my brow, as you 
do. I was a fool. But Abel was a_ discoverer, a 
man of ideas, of spirit: a true Progressive. He was the 
discoverer of blood. He was the inventor of killing. 
He found out that the fire of the sun could be brought 
down by a dewdrop. He invented the altar to keep the 
fire alive. He changed the beasts he killed into meat by 
the fire on the altar. He kept himself alive by eating 
meat. His meal cost him a day’s glorious health-giving 


Act II In the Beginning 23 


sport and an hour’s amusing play with the fire. You 
learnt nothing from him: you drudged and drudged and 
drudged, and dug and dug and dug, and made me do 
the same. I envied his happiness, his freedom. I 
despised myself for not doing as he did instead of what 
you did. He became so happy that he shared his meal 
with the Voice that had whispered all his inventions to 
him. He said that the Voice was the voice of the -fire 
that cooked his food, and that the fire that could cook 
could also eat. It was true: I saw the fire consume the 
food on his altar. Then I, too, made an altar, and 
offered my food on it, my grains, my roots, my fruit. 
Useless: nothing happened. He laughed at me; and 
then came my great idea: why not kill him as he killed 
the beasts? I struck; and he died, just as they did. 
Then I gave up your old silly drudging ways, and lived 
as he had lived, by the chase, by the killing, and by the 
fire. Am I not better than you? stronger, happier, 
freer? 

Apam. You are not stronger: you are shorter in the 
wind: you cannot endure. You ‘have made the beasts 
afraid of us; and the snake has invented poison to pro- 
tect herself against you. I fear you myself. If you 
take a step towards your mother with that spear of 
yours I will strike you with my spade as you struck 
Abel. 

Eve. He will not strike me. He loves me. 

Apam. He loved his brother. But he killed him. 

cams. Ido not want to kill women. I do not want to 
kill my mother. And for her sake I will not kill you, 
though I could send this spear through you without 
coming within reach of your spade. But for her, I 
could not resist the sport of trying to kill you, in spite 
of my fear that you would kill me. I have striven with 
a boar and with a lion as to which of us should kill the 


24 In the Beginning Part I 


other. I have striven with a man: spear to spear and 
shield to shield. It is terrible; but there is no joy like 
it. I call it fighting. He who has never fought has 
never lived. Thatis what has brought me to my mother 
today. 

ge What liave you to do with one another now? 
She is the creator, you the destroyer. 

cain. How can I destroy unless she creates? I want 
her to create more and more men: aye, and more and 
more women, that they may in turn create more men. I 
have imagined a glorious poem of many men, or more 
men than there are leaves on a thousand trees. I will 
divide them into two great hosts. One of them I will 
lead; and the other will be led by the man I fear most 
and desire to fight and kill most. And each host shall 
try to kill the other host. Think of that! all those 
multitudes of men fighting, fighting, killing, killing! 
The four rivers running with blood! The shouts of 
triumph! the howls of rage! the curses of despair! the 
shrieks of torment! That will be life indeed: life lived 
to the very marrow: burning, overwhelming life. Every 
man who has not seen it, heard it, felt it, risked it, will 
feel a humbled foo] in the presence of the man who has. 

rve. AndI! I am to bea mere convenience to make 
men for you to kill! 

apam. Or to kill you, you fool. 

caIn. Mother: the making of men is your right, your 
risk, your agony, your glory, your triumph. You make 
my father here your mere convenience, as you call it, 
for that. He has to dig for you, sweat for you, plod 
for you, like the ox who helps him to tear up the ground 
or the ass who carries his burdens for him. No woman 
shall make me live my father’s life. I will hunt: I will 
fight and strive to the very bursting of my sinews. 
When I have slain the boar at the risk of my life, I will 


Act II In the Beginning 25 


throw it to my woman to cook, and give her a morsel of 
it for her pains. She shall have no other food; and that 
will make her my slave. And the man that slays me 
shall have her for his booty. Man shall be the master 
of Woman, not her baby and her drudge. 

Adam throws down his spade, and stands looking 
darkly at Eve. 

EvE. Are you tempted, Adam? Does this seem a 
better thing to you than love between us. 

cain. What does he know of love? Only when he 
has fought, when he has faced terror and death, when 
he has striven to the spending of the last rally of his 
strength, can he know what it is to rest in love in the 
arms of a woman. Ask that woman whom you made, 
who is also my wife, whether she would have me as I was 
in the days when I followed the ways of Adam, and was 
a digger and a drudge? 

EVE [angrily throwing down her distaff | What! You 
dare come here boasting about that good-for-nothing 
Lua, the worst of daughters and the worst of wives! 
You her master! You are more her slave than Adam’s 
ox or your own sheep-dog. Forsooth, when you have 
slain the boar at the risk of your life, you will throw 
her a morsel of it for her pains! Ha! Poor wretch: do 
you think I do not know her, and know you, better than 
that? Do you risk your life when you trap the ermine 
and the sable and the blue fox to hang on her lazy 
shoulders and make her look more like an animal than 
a woman? When you have to snare the little tender 
birds because it is too much trouble for ‘her to chew 
honest food, how much of a great warrior do you feel 
then? You slay the tiger at the risk of your life; but 
who gets the striped skin you have run that risk’for? 
She takes it to lie on, and flings you the carrion flesh 
you cannot eat. You fight because you think that your 


26 In the Beginning Part I 


fighting makes her admire and desire you. Fool: she 
makes you fight because you bring her the ornaments 
and the treasures of those you have slain, and because 
she is courted and propitiated with power and gold by 
the people who fear you. You say that J make a mere 
convenience of Adam: I who spin and keep the house, 
and bear and rear children, and am a woman and not a 
pet animal to please men and prey on them! What are 
you, you poor slave of a painted face and a bundle of 
skunk’s fur? You were a man-child when I bore you. 
Lua was a woman-child when I bore her. What have 
you made of yourselves ? 

caln [letting his spear fall into the crook of his shield 
arm, and twirlmg his moustache] There is something 
higher than man. There is hero and superman. 

EVE. Superman! You are no superman: you are 
Anti-Man: you are to other men what the stoat is to the 
rabbit; and she is to you what the leech is to the stoat. 
You despise your father; but when he dies the world will 
be the richer because he lived. When you die, men will 
say, “He was a great warrior; but it would have been 
better for the world if he had never been born.” And of 
Lua they will say nothing; but when they think of her 
they will spit. 

caIn. She is a better sort of woman to live with than 
you. If Lua nagged at me as you are nagging, and as 
you nag at Adam, I would beat her black and blue from 
head to foot. Ihave done it too, slave as you say I am. 

EvE. Yes, because she looked at another man. And 
then you grovelled at her feet, and cried, and begged 
her to forgive you, and were ten times more her slave 
than ever; and she, when she had finished screaming and 
the pain went off a little, she forgave you, did she not? 

cain. She loved me more than ever. That is the true 
nature of woman. 


Act Ll in the Beginning 27 


EVE [now pitymg him maternally] Love! You call 
that love! You call that the nature of woman! My 
boy: this is neither man nor woman nor love nor life, 
2 have no real strength in your bones nor sap in your 

esh. 

caIn. Ha! [He seizes his spear and swings it mus- 
cularly |. 

EvE. Yes: you have to twirl a stick to feel your 
strength: you cannot taste life without making it bitter 
and boiling hot: you cannot love Lua until her face is 
painted, nor feel the natural warmth of her flesh until 
you have stuck a squirrel’s fur on it. You can feel noth- 
ing but a torment, and believe nothing but a lie. You 
will not raise your head to look at all the miracles of 
life that surround you; but you will run ten miles to see 
a fight or a death. 

apAM. Enough said. Let the boy alone. 

cain. Boy! Ha! ha! 

Eve [to Adam] You think, perhaps, that his way of 
life may be better than yours after all. You are still 
tempted. Well, will you pamper me as he pampers his 
woman? Will you kill tigers and bears until I have a 
heap of their skins to lounge on? Shall I paint my face 
and let my arms waste into pretty softness, and eat 
partridges and doves, and the flesh of kids whose milk 
you will steal for me? 

apam. You are hard enough to bear with as you are. 
Stay as you are; and] will stay aslam. — . 

cain. You neither of you know anything about life. 
You are simple country folk. You are the nurses and 
valets of the oxen and dogs and asses you have tamed to 
work for you. I can raise you out of that. I have a 
plan. Why not tame men and women to work for us? 
Why not bring them up from childhood never to know 
any other lot, so that they may believe that we are gods, 


28 In the Beginning Part 


and that they are here only to make life glorious for us? 

apam [impresssd| That is a great thought, certainly. 

EVE [contemptuously| Great thought! 

apam, Well, as the serpent used to say, why not? 

evE. Because I would not have such wretches in my 
house. Because I hate creatures with two heads, or with 
withered limbs, or that are distorted and perverted and 
unnatural. I have told Cain already that he is not a man 
and that Lua is not a woman: they are monsters. And 
now you want to make still more unnatural monsters, so 
that you may be utterly lazy and worthless, and that 
your tamed human animals may find work a blasting 
curse. A fine dream, truly! [T'oCain]. Your father 
is a fool skin deep; but you are a fool to your very 
marrow; and your baggage of a wife is worse. 

apam. Why amJIa fool? How amJ a greater fool 
than your 

EvE. You said there would be no killing because the 
Voice would tell.our children that they must not kill, 
Why did it not tell Cain that? 

cain. It did; but I am not a child to be afraid of a 
Voice. The Voice thought I was nothing but my broth- 
er’s keeper. It found that I was myself, and that it 
was for Abel to be himself also, and look to himself. 
He was not my keeper any more than I was his: why 
did he not kill me? There was no more to prevent him 
than there was to prevent me: it was man to man; and I 
won. I was the first conqueror. 

ADAM. What did the Voice say to you when you 
thought all that? 

cain. Why, it gave me right. It said that my deed 
was as a mark on me, a burnt-in mark such as Abel put 
on his sheep, that no man should slay me. And here I 
stand unslain, whilst the cowards who have never slain, 
the men who are content to be their brothers’ keepers 


ACU Ld Au wie DegInning 29 


instead of their masters, are despised and rejected, and 
slain like rabbits. He who bears the brand of Cain shall 
rule the earth. When he falls, he shall be avenged seven- 
fold: the Voice has said it; so beware how you plot 
against me, you and all the rest. 

apaM. Cease your boasting and bullying, and tell 
the truth. Does not the Voice tell you that as no man 
dare slay you for murdering your brother, you ought to 
slay yourself? 

cain. No. 

ADAM. ‘Then there is no such thing as divine justice, 
unless you are lying. 

cain. J am not lying: I dare all truths. There is 
divine justice. For the Voice tells me that I must offer 
myself to every man to be killed if he can kill me. With- 
out danger I cannot be great. That is how I pay for 
Abel’s blood. Danger and fear follow my steps every- 
where. Without them courage would have no sense. 
And it is courage, courage, courage, that raises the blood 
of life to crimson splendor. 

apam [picking up his spade and preparing to dig 
again| Take yourself off then. This splendid life of 
yours does not last for a thousand years; and I must 
last for a thousand years. When you fighters do not 
get killed in fighting one another or fighting the beasts, 
you die from mere evil in yourselves. Your flesh ceases 
to grow like man’s flesh: it grows like a fungus on a 
tree. Instead of breathing, you sneeze, or cough up your 
insides, and wither and perish. Your bowels become 
rotten ; your hair falls from you; your teeth blacken and 
drop out; and you die before your time, not because you 
will, but because you must. I will dig, and live. 

carn. And pray, what use is this thousand years of 
life to you, you old vegetable? Do you dig any better 
because you have been digging for hundreds of years? 


3U An me Deyuuiip cara 


I have not lived as long as you; but I know all there is 
to be known, of the craft of digging. By quitting it I 
have set myself free to learn nobler crafts of which you 
know nothing. I know the craft of fighting and of hunt- 
ing: in a word, the craft of killmg. What certainty 
have you of your thousand years? I could kill both of 
you; and you could no more defend yourselves than a 
couple of sheep. I spare you; but others may kill you. 
Why not live bravely, and die early and make room for 
others? Why, I—I! that know many more crafts than 
either of you, am tired of myself when I am not fighting 
or hunting. Sooner than face a thousand years of it I 
should kill myself, as the Voice sometimes tempts me to 
do already. 

apam. Liar: you denied just now that it called on 
you to pay for Abel’s life with your own. 

cats. The Voice does not speak to me as it does to 
you. I ama man: you are only a grown-up child. One 
does not speak to a child as to aman. And a man does 
not listen and tremble in silence. He replies: he makes 
the Voice respect him: in the end he dictates what the 
Voice shall say. 

apaM. May your tongue be accurst for such blas- 
phemy ! 

EvE. Keep a guard on your own tongue; and do not 
curse my son. It was Lilith who did wrong when she 
shared the labor of creation so unequally between man 
and wife. If you, Cain, had had the trouble of making 
Abel, or had had to make another man to replace him 
when he was gone, you would not have killed him: you 
would have risked your own life to save ‘his. That is 
why all this empty talk of yours, which tempted Adam 
just now when ‘he threw down his spade and listened to 
you for a while, went by me like foul wind that has 
passed over a dead body. That is why there is enmity 


Act II In the Beginning 31 


between Woman the creator and Man the destroyer. I 
know you: I am your mother. You are idle: you are 
selfish. It is long and hard and painful to create life: 
it is short and easy to steal the life others have made. 
When you dug, you made the earth live and bring forth 
as I live and bring forth. It was for that that Lilith 
set you free from the travail of women, not for theft 
and murder. 

caIn. The Devil thank her for it! I can make better 
use of my time than to play the husband to the clay be- 
neath my feet. 

ApaM. Devil? What new word is that? 

caIN. Hearken to me, old fool. I have never in my 
soul listened willingly when you have told me of the Voice 
that whispers to you. There must be two Voices: one 
that gulls and despises you, and another that trusts and 
respects me. I call yours the Devil. Mine I call the 
Voice of God. 

ADAM. Mine is the Voice of Life: yours the Voice of 
Death. 

caIn. Be itso. For it whispers to me that death is 
not really death: that it is the gate of another life; a 
life infinitely splendid and intense: a life of the soul 
alone: a life without clods or spades, hunger or fatigue— 

EvE. Selfish and idle, Cain. I know. 

cain. Selfish, yes: a life in which no man is his broth- 
er’s keeper, because his brother can keep ‘himself. But 
am J idle? In rejecting your drudgery, have I not em- 
braced evils and agonies of which you know nothing? 
The arrow is lighter in the hand than the spade; but the 
energy that drives it through the breast of a fighter is as 
fire to water compared with the strength that drives the 
spade into the harmless dirty clay. My strength is as 
the strength of ten because my heart is pure. 

apamM. What is that word? What is pure? 


oZ in tne beginning KUarus 


cain. Turned from the clay. Turned upward to the 
sun, to the clear clean heavens. 

apam. ‘The heavens are empty, child. The earth is 
fruitful. The earth feeds us. It gives us the strength 
by which we made you and all mankind. Cut off from 
the clay which you despise, you would perish miserably. 

cain. I revolt against the clay. I revolt against the 
food. You say it gives strength: does it not also turn 
into filth and smite us with diseases? I revolt against 
these births that you and mother are so proud of. They 
drag us down to the level of the beasts. If that is to be 
the last thing as it has been the first, Jet mankind perish. 
If I am to eat like a bear, if Lua is to bring forth cubs 
like a bear, then I had rather be a bear than a man; for 
the bear is not ashamed: he knows no better. If you are 
content, like the bear, I am not. Stay with the woman 
who gives you children: I will go to the woman who 
gives me dreams. Grope in the ground for your food: 
I will bring it from the skies with my arrows, or strike 
it down as it roams the earth in the pride of its life. If 
I must have food or die, I will at least have it at as far 
a remove from the earth asI can. The ox shall make it 
something nobler than grass before it comes to me. And 
as the man is nobler than the ox, I shall some day let my 
enemy eat the ox; and then I will slay and eat him. 

ADAM. Monster! You hear this, Eve? 

EVE. So that is what comes of turning your face to 
the clean clear heavens! Man-eating! Child-eating! 
For that is what it would come to, just as it came to 
lambs and kids when Abel began with sheep and goats. 
You are a poor silly creature after all. Do you think 
I never have these thoughts: I! who ‘have the labor of 
the child-bearing: I! who have the drudgery of prepar- 
ing the food? I thought for a moment that perhaps. 
this strong brave son of mine, who could imagine some- 


Act LL in the Beginning 33 


thing better, and could desire what he imagined, might 
also be able to will what he desired until he created it. 
And all that comes of it is that he wants to be a bear 
and eat children. Even a bear would not eat a man if 
it could get honey instead. 

cain. Ido not want to be a bear. I do not want to 
eat children. I do not know what I want, except that I 
want to be something higher and nobler than this stupid 
old digger whom Lilith made to help you to bring me 
into the world, and whom you despise now that he has 
served your turn. 

apam [in sullen rage | I have half a mind to shew you 
that my spade can split your undutiful head open, m 
spite of your spear. 

cain. Undutiful! Ha! ha! [Flourishing his spear |. 
Try it, old everybody’s father. Try a taste of fighting. 

EVE. Peace, peace, you two fools. Sit down and be 
quiet; and listen to me. [Adam with a weary shrug, 
throws down his spade. Cain, with a laughing one 
fhrows down his shield and spear. Both sit on the 
ground]. Ihardly know which of you satisfies me least, 
you with your dirty digging, or he with his dirty killing. 
I cannot think it was for either of these cheap ways of 
life that Lilith set you free. [To Adam]. You dig 
roots and coax grains out of the earth: why do you not 
draw down a divine sustenance from the skies? He steals 
and kills for his food; and makes up idle poems of life 
after death; and dresses up his terror-ridden life with 
fine words and his disease-ridden body with fine clothes, 
so that men may glorify and honor him instead of curs- 
ing him as murderer and thief. All you men, except 
only Adam, are my sons, or my sons’ sons, or my sons’ 
sons’? sons: you all come to see me: you all shew off 
before me: all your little wisdoms and accomplishments 
are trotted out before mother Eve. The diggers come: 


54 in the beginning Fart. 


the fighters and killers come: they are both very dull; 
for they either complain to me of the last harvest, or 
boast to me of the last fight; and one harvest is just 
like another, and the last fight only a repetition of the 
first. Oh, I have heard it all a thousand times. They 
tell me too of their last-born: the clever thing the darling 
child said yesterday, and how much more wonderful or 
witty or quaint it is than any child that ever was born 
before. And I have to pretend to be surprised, delighted, 
interested; though the last child is like the first, and has 
said and done nothing that did not delight Adam and me 
when you and Abel said it. For you were the first chil- 
dren in the world, and filled us with such wonder and 
delight as no couple can ever again feel while the world 
lasts. When I can bear no more, I go to our old garden, 
that is now a mass of nettles and thistles, in the hope 
of finding the serpent to talk to. But you have made 
the serpent our enemy: she has left the garden, or is 
dead: I never see her now. So I have to come back and 
listen to Adam saying the same thing for the ten-thou- 
sandth time, or to receive a visit from the last great- 
great-grandson who has grown up and wants to impress 
me with his importance. Qh, it is dreary, dreary! And 
there is yet nearly seven hundred years of it to endure, 

cain. Poor mother! You see, life is too long. One 
tires of everything. ‘There is nothing new under the 
sun. 
ava [to Eve, grumpily] Why do you live on, if you 
ean find nothing bétter to do than complain? 

EvE. Because there is still hope. 

cain. Of what? 

reve. Of the coming true of your dreams and mine. 
Of newly created things. Of better things. My sons 
and my sons’ sons are not all diggers and fighters. Some 
of them will neither dig nor fight: they are more useless 


Act II In the Beginning 35 


than either of you: they are weaklings and cowards: 
they are vain; yet they are dirty and will not take the 
trouble to cut their hair. They borrow and never pay; 
but one gives them what they want, because they tell 
beautiful lies in beautiful words. They can remember 
their dreams. They can dream without sleeping. They 
have not will enough to create instead of dreaming; but 
the serpent said that every dream could be willed into 
creation by those strong enough to believe in it. There 
are others who cut reeds of different lengths and blow 
through them, making lovely patterns of sound in the 
air; and some of them can weave the patterns together, 
sounding three reeds at the same time, and raising my 
soul to things for which I have no words. And others 
make little mammoths out of clay, or make faces appear 
on flat stones, and ask me to create women for them with 
such faces. I have watched those faces and willed; and 
then I have made a woman-child that has grown up quite 
like them. And others think of numbers without having 
to count on their fingers, and watch the sky at night, and 
give names to the stars, and can foretell when the sun 
will be covered with a black saucepan lid. And there is 
Tubal, who made his wheel for me which has saved me so 
much labor. And there is Enoch, who walks on the hills, 
and hears the Voice continually, and has given up his 
will to do the will of the Voice, and has some of the 
Voice’s greatness. When they come, there is always 
some new wonder, or some new hope: something to live 
for. They never want to die, because they are always 
learning and always creating either things or wisdom, 
or at least dreaming of them. And then you, Cain, 
come to me with your stupid fighting and destroying, 
and your foolish boasting: and you want me to tell you 
that it is all splendid, and that you are heroic, and that 
nothing but death or the dread of death makes life worth 


36 In the Beginning Part I 


living. Away with you, naughty child; and do you, 
Adam, go on with your work and not waste your time 
listening to him. 

cain. I am not, perhaps, very clever; but— 

EVE [interrupting him] Perhaps not ; but do not begin 
to boast of that. It is no credit to you. 

cain. For all that, mother, I have an instinct which 
tells me that death plays its part in life. Tell me this: 
who invented death? 

Adam springs to his feet. Eve drops her distaff. Both 
shew the greatest consternation. 

cain. What is the matter with you both? 

ApaM. Boy: you have asked us a terrible question. 

Eve. You invented murder. Let that be enough for 
you. 

carn, Murder is not death. You know what I mean. 
Those whom IJ slay would die if I spared them. If I am 
not slain, yet I shall die. Who put this upon me? I 
say, who invented death? 

ADAM. Be reasonable, boy. Could you bear to live 
for ever? You think you could, because you know that 
you will never have to make your thought good. But I 
have known what it is to sit and brood under the terror 
of eternity, of immortality. ‘Think of it, man! to have 
no escape! to be Adam, Adam, Adam through more 
days than there are grains of sand by the two rivers, 
and then be as far from the end as ever! I, who have 
so much in me that I hate and long to cast off! Be 
thankful to your parents, who enabled you.to hand on 
your burden to new and better men, and won for you 
an eternal rest; for it was we who invented death. 

cain [rising] You did well: I, too, do not want to live 
for ever. But if you invented death, why do you blame 
me, who am a minister of death? 


Act i in the Beginning 37 


ApAM. I do not blame you. Go in peace. Leave me 
to my digging, and your mother to her spinning. 

cain. Well, I will leave you to it, though I have 
shewn you a better way. [He picks up his shield and 
spear}. -I will go back to my brave warrior friends and 
their splendid women. [He strides to the thorn brake]. 
When Adam delved and Eve span, where was then the 
gentleman? [He goes away roaring with laughter, 
which ceases as he cries from the distance]. Good-bye,~ 
mother. 

avam [grumbling] He might have put the hurdle 
back, lazy hound! [He replaces the hurdle across the 
passage |. 

Eve. Through him and his like, death is gaining on 
life. Already most of our grandchildren die before they 
have sense enough to know how to live. 

apam. No matter. [He spits on his hands, and takes 
up the spade again]. Life is still long enough to learn 
to dig, short as they are making it. 

EVE [musing] Yes, to dig. And to fight. But is it 
long enough for the other things, the great things? 
Will they live long enough to eat manna? 

apamM. What is manna? 

EVE. Food drawn down from heaven, made out of the 
air, not dug dirtily from the earth. Will they learn.all 
the ways of all the stars in their little time? It took 
Enoch two hundred years to learn to intercept the will 
of the Voice. When he was a mere child of eighty, his 
babyish attempts to understand the Voice were more 
dangerous than the wrath of Cain. If they shorten 
their lives, they will dig and fight and kill and die; and 
their baby Enochs will tell them that it is the will of the 
Voice that they should dig and fight and kill and die 
for ever. 

apam. If they are lazy and have a will towards death 


38 In the Beginning Part 1 


I cannot help it. I will live my thousand years: if they 
will not, let them die and be damned. 

EVE. Damned? What is that? 

apaM. The state of them that love death more than 
life. Go on with your spinning; and do not sit there 
idle while I am straining my muscles for you. 

EVE [slowly taking up her distaff | If you were not a 
fool you would find something better for both of us to 
live by than this spinning and digging. 

Adam. Go on with your work, I tell you; or you shall 
go without bread. 

EVE. Man need not always live by bread alone. 
There is something else. We do not yet know what it 
is; but some day we shall find out; and then we will live 
on that alone; and there shall be no more digging nor 
spinning, nor fighting nor killing. 

She spins resignedly: he digs impatiently. 


PART II 


THE GOSPEL 
OF THE BROTHERS BARNABAS 


XXXII 


THE GOSPEL 
OF THE BROTHERS BARNABAS 


In the first years after the war an tmpresstve-looking 
gentleman of 50 is seated writing in a well-furnished 
spacious study. He is dressed in black. His coat is a 
frock-coat; his tie is white; and his waistcoat, though it 
is not quite a clergyman’s waistcoat, and his collar, 
though it buttons in front instead of behind, combine 
with the prosperity indicated by his surroundings, and 
his air of personal distinction, to suggest the clerical 
dignitary. Still, he is clearly neither dean nor bishop; 
he is rather too starkly intellectual for a popular Free 
Church enthusiast; and he is not careworn enough to be 
@ great headmaster. 

The study windows, which have broad comfortable 
window seats, overlook Hampstead Heath towards Lon- 
don. Consequently, it being a fine afternoon in spring, 
the room is sunny. As you face these windows, you have 
on your right the fireplace, with a few logs smouldering 
in it, and a couple of comfortable library chairs on the 
hearth-rug; beyond it and beside tt the door; before you 
the writing-table, at whitch the clerical gentleman sits a 
little to your left facing the door with his right profile 
presented to you; on your left a settee; and on your 
right a couple of Chippendale chairs. There is also an 
upholstered square stool im the middle of the room, 
against the writing-table. The walls are covered with 
bookshelves above and lockers beneath. 

Al 


42 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


The door opens; and another gentleman, shorter than 
the clerical one, within a year or two of the same age, 
dressed in a well-worn tweed lounge suit, with a short 
beard and much less style in his bearing and carriage, 
looks in. 

THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN [familiar and by no means 
cordial] Hallo! I didnt expect you until the five o’clock 
train. 

THE TWEEDED GENTLEMAN [coming in very slowly] 
I have something on my mind. [I thought I’d come 
early. 

THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN [throwing down his pen] 
What is on your mind? 

THE TWEEDED GENTLEMAN [ sitting down on the stool, 
heavily preoccupied with his thought] I have made up 
my mind at last about the time. I make it three hun- 
dred years. 

THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN | sitting wp energetically] 
Now that is extraordinary. Most extraordinary. The 
very last words I wrote when you interrupted me were 
“at least three centuries.” [He snatches up his manu- 
script and points to it]. THere it is: [reading] “the 
term of human life must be extended to at least three 
centuries.” 

THE TWEEDED GENTLEMAN. How did you arrive at it? 
. _4 parlor maid opens the door, ushering in a young 

clergyman. 

THE PARLOR MAID. Mr Haslam. [She withdraws]. 

The visitor is so very unwelcome that his host forgets 
to rise; and the two brothers stare at the intruder, quite 
unable to conceal their dismay. Haslam, who has noth- 
img clerical about him except his collar, and wears a 
snuff-colored suit, smiles with a frank schoolboyishness 
that makes it impossible to be unkind to him, and ex 
plodes mto obviously unpremeditated speech. 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 43 


HasLAM. I’m afraid I’m an awful nuisance. I’m 
the rector ; and I suppose one ought to call on people. 

THE TWEEDED GENTLEMAN [in ghostly tones] We're 
not Church people, you know. 

HASLAM. Oh, I dont mind that, if you dont. The 
Church people here are mostly as dull as ditch-water. I 
have heard such a lot about you; and there are so jolly 
few people to talk to. I thought you perhaps wouldnt 
mind, Do you mind? for of course I'll go like a shot if 
I’m in the way. 

THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN [Tising, disarmed] Sit 
down Mr—er? 

HASLAM. Haslam. 

THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN. Mr Haslam. 

THE TWEEDED GENTLEMAN [rising and offering him 
the stool] Sit down. [He retreats towards the Chippen- 
dale chairs |. 

HASLAM [sitting down on the stool] Thanks awfully. 

THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN [resuming his seat| This 
is my brother Conrad, Professor of Biology at Jarrow- 
fields University: Dr Conrad Barnabas. My name is 
Franklyn: Franklyn Barnabas. I was in the Church 
myself for some years. 

nas~am [sympathizing] Yes: one cant help it. If 
theres a living in the family, or one’s Governor knows 
a patron, one gets shoved into the Church by one’s 
parents. 

conrap [sitting down on the furthest Chippendale 
with a snort of amusement| Mp! 

FRANKLYN. One gets shoved out of it, sometimes, by 
one’s conscience. 

wasLaM. Oh yes; but where is a chap like me to goP 
I’m afraid I’m not intellectual enough to split straws 
when theres a job in front of me, and nothing better for 
me to do. I daresay the Church was a bit thick for you; 


44 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


but it’s good enough for me. It will last my time, any~ 
how. [He laughs good-humoredly }. 

FRANKLYN [with renewed energy | There again! You 
see, Con, It will last his time. Life is too short for men 
to take it seriously. 

Hastam. Thats a way of looking at it, certainly. 

FRANKLYN. I was not shoved into the Church, Mr 
Haslam: I felt it to be my vocation to walk with God, 
like Enoch. After twenty years of it I realized that I 
was walking with my own ignorance and self-conceit, 
and that I was not within a hundred and fifty years of 
the experience and wisdom I was pretending to. 

HAsLtAM. Now I come to think of it, old Methuselah 
must have ‘had to think twice before he took on anything 
for life. If I thought I was going to live nine hundred 
and sixty years, I dont think I should stay in the 
Church. | 

FRANKLYN. If men lived even a third of that time, 
the Church would be very different to the thing it is. 

conrad. If I could count on nine hundred and sixty 
years I could make myself a real biologist, instead of 
what I am now: a child trying to walk. Are you sure 
you might not become a good clergyman if you had a 
few centuries to do it in? 

Has~aM. Qh, theres nothing much the matter with 
me: it?s quite easy to be a decent parson. It’s the 
Church that chokes me off. I couldnt stick it for nine 
hundred years. I should chuck it. You know, some- 
times, when the bishop, who is the most priceless of 
fossils, lets off something more than usually out-of-date 
the bird starts in my garden. 

FRANKLYN. The bird? 

HASLAM. Oh yes. Theres a bird there that keeps on 
singing “Stick it or chuck it: stick it or chuck it”—just 


PartII Gospel Or me brome4rs—parnabas 45 


like that—for an hour on end in the spring. I wish my 
father had found some other shop for me. . 

The parlor maid comes back. 

THE PARLOR MAID. Any letters for the post, sir? 

FRANKLYN. These. [He proffers a basket of letters. 
She comes to the table and takes them]. 

HASLAM [to the maid] Have you told Mr Barnabas 
yet? 

THE PARLOR MAID [ flinching a little] No, sir. 

FRANKLYN. Told me what? 

HASLAM. She is going to leave you? 

FRANKLYN. Indeed? I’m sorry. Is it our fault, Mr 
Haslam? 

HASLAM. Nota bit. She is jolly well off here. 

THE PARLOR MAID [reddening | I have never denied it, 
sir: I couldnt ask for a better place. But I have only 
one life to live; and I maynt get a second chance. Ex- 
cuse me, sir; but the letters must go to catch the post. 
[She goes out with the letters]. 

The two brothers look enquiringly at Haslam. 

HASLAM. Silly girl! Going to marry a village wood- 
man and live in a hovel with him and a lot of ‘kids 
tumbling over one another, just because the fellow has 
poetic-looking eyes and a moustache. 

conraD [demurring] She said it was because .she had 
only one life. | 

HASLAM. Same thing, poor girl! The fellow per- 
suaded her to chuck it; and when she marries him she’ll 
have to stick it. Rotten state of things, I call it. 

conzaD. You see, she hasnt time to find out what life 
really means. She has to die before she knows. 

Hasiam [agreeably] Thats it. 

FRANKLYN. She hasnt time to form a well-instructed 
conscience. 

HasLAM [still more cheerfully] Quite. 


46 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


FRANELYN. It goes deeper. She hasnt time to form 
& genuine conscience at all. Some romantic points of 
honor and a few conventions. A world without con- 
science: that is the horror of our condition. 

wastam [beaming] Simply fatuous. [ Rising}. 
Well, I suppose I’d better be going. It’s most awfully 
good of you to put up with my calling. 

conzap [in his former low ghostly tone] You neednt 
go, you know, if you are really interested. 

HasLamM [fed up] Well, I’m afraid I ought to—] 
really must get back—I have something to do.in the— 

FRANKLYN [smiling benignly and rising to proffer his 
hand| Good-bye. 

conrap [gruffly, giving him up as a bad job) Good- 
bye. 

HAsLAM. Good-bye. Sorry—er— 

As the rector moves to shake hands with Franklyn, 
feeling that he is makimg a frightful mess of his depart- 
ure, a vigorous sunburnt young lady with hazel hair cut 
to the level of her neck, like an Italian youth in a Goz- 
zolt picture, comes mm impetuously. She seems to have 
nothing on but her short skirt, her blouse, her stock- 
mgs, and a pair of Norwegian shoes: m short, she is a 
Simple-Lifer. 

THE SIMPLE-LIFER [swooping on Conrad and kissing 
him] Hallo, Nunk. Youre before your time. 

congap. Behave yourself. Theres a visitor, 

She turns quickly and sees the rector. She instine- 
tively switches at her Gozzoli fringe with her fingers, but 
gives tt up as hopeless. 

FRANKLYN. Mr Haslam, our new rector. [T7'o Has- 
lam]. My daughter Cynthia. 

conrap. Usually called Savvy, short for Savage. 

savvy. ( usually call Mr Haslam Bill, short fo1 


PartII Gospel of the Brotners barnabas AT 


William. [She strolls to the hearth-rug, and surveys 
them calmly from that commanding position]. 

FRANKLYN. You know him? 

savvy. Rather. Sit down, Bill. 

FRANKLYN. Mr Haslam is going, Savvy. He has an 
engagement, 

savvy. I know. I’m the engagement. 

conraD. In that case, would you mind taking him 
into the garden while I talk to your father? 

savvy [to Haslam] Tennis? 

HasLaM. Rather! 

savvy. Come on. [She dances out. He runs out 
boyishly after her]. 

FRANKLYN [leaving his table and beginning to walk 
up and down the room discontentedly| Savvy’s manners 
jar on me. They would have horrified her grandmother. 

conraD [obstinately] They are happier manners than 
Mother’s manners. 

FRANKLYN. Yes: they are franker, wholesomer, better 
in a hundred ways. And yet I squirm at them. I can- 
not get it out of my head that Mother was a well-man- 
nered woman, and that Savvy has no manners at all. 

conrap. ‘There wasnt any pleasure in Mother’s fine 
manners. That makes a biological difference. 

FRANKLYN. But there was beauty in Mother’s man- 
ners, grace in them, style in them: above all, decision in 
them. Savvy is such a cub. 

conraD. So she ought to be, at her age. 

FRANKLYN. There it comes again! Her age! her 
age! 

sieht You want her to be fully grown at eighteen. 
You want to force her into a stuck-up, artificial, prema- 
ture self-possession before she has any self to possess. 
You just let her alone: she is right enough for her years. 
FRANKLYN. I have let her alone; and look at the re- 


48 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


sult! Like all the other young people who have been let 
alone, she becomes a Socialist. ‘That is, she becomes 
hopelessly demoralized. 

conraD. Well, arnt you a Socialist? 

FRANKLYN. Yes; but that is not the same thing. 
You and I were brought up in the old bourgeois moral- 
ity. We were taught bourgeois manners and bourgeois 
points of honor. Bourgeois manners may be snobbish 
manners: there may be no pleasure in them, as you say; 
but they are better than no manners. Many bourgeois 
points of honor may be false; but at least they exist. 
The women know what to expect and what is expected 
of them. Savvy doesnt. She is a Bolshevist and nothing 
else. She has to improvize her manners and her con- 
duct as she goes along. It’s often charming, no doubt; 
but sometimes she puts her foot in it frightfully; and 
then I feel that she is blaming me for not teaching her 
better. 

conrap. Well, you have something better to teach | 
her now, at all events. 

FRANKLYN. Yes; but it is too late. She doesnt trust 
me now. She doesnt talk about such things to me. She 
doesnt read anything I write. She never comes to hear 
me lecture. I am out of it as far as Savvy is concerned. 
[He resumes his seat at the writing-table}. 

conrap. I must have a talk to her. 

FRANKLYN, Perhaps she will listen to you. You are 
not her father. 

congaD. [I sent her my last book. I can break the 
ice by asking her what she made of it. 

FRANKLYN. When she heard you were coming, she 
asked me whether all the leaves were cut, in case it fell 
into your hands. She hasnt read a word of it. 

conRaD [rising indignantly] What! 

FRANKLYN [inexorably] Not a word of it. 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 49 


conrap [beaten] Well, I suppose it’s only natural. 
Biology is a dry subject for a girl; and I am a pretty 
dry old codger. [He sits down again resignedly |. 

FRANKLYN. Brother: if that is so; if biology as you 
have worked at it, and religion as I have worked at it, 
are dry subjects like the old stuff they taught under 
these names, and we two are dry old codgers, like the old 
preachers and professors, then the Gospel of the Broth- 
ers Barnabas is a delusion. Unless this withered thing 
religion, and this dry thing science, have come alive in 
our hands, alive and intensely interesting, we may just 
as well go out and dig the garden until it is time to dig 
our graves. [The parlor maid returns. Franklyn is 
impatient at the interruption]. Well? what is it now? 

THE PARLOR MAID. Mr Joyce Burge on the telephone, 
sir. He wants to speak to you. 

FRANKLYN [ astonished| Mr Joyce Burge! 

THE PARLOR MAID. Yé6s5, Sirf. 

FRANKLYN [to Conrad] What on earth does this 
mean? I havnt heard from him nor exchanged a word 
with him for years. I resigned the chairmanship of the 
Liberal Association and shook the dust of party politics 
from my feet before he was Prime Minister in the Coali- 
tion. Of course, he dropped me like a hot potato. 

conrap. Well, now that the Coalition has chucked 
him out, and he is only one of the half-dozen leaders of 
the Opposition, perhaps he wants to pick you up again. 

THE PARLOR Map [warningly| He is holding the line, 
sir. 

FRANKLYN. Yes:allright. [He hurries out]. 

The parlor maid goes to the hearthrug to make up the 
fire. Conrad rises and strolls to the middle of the room, 
where he stops and looks quizzically down at her. 

conrap. Sc you have only one life to live, eh? 


50 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part IT 


THE PARLOR Main [dropping on her knees im conster- 
nation] I meant no offence, sir. 

conrap. You didnt give any. But you know you 
could live a devil of a long life if you really wanted to. 

THE PARLOR MAID [sitting down on her heels | Oh dont 
say that, sir. It’s so unsettling. 

conrap. Why? Have you been thinking about it? 

THE PARLOR MAID. It would never have come into 
my head if you hadnt put it there, sir. Me and cook 
had a look at your book. 

conrap. What! 

You and cook 

Had a look 

‘At my book! 
And my niece wouldnt open it! The prophet is without 
honor in his own family. Well, what do you think of 
living for several hundred years? Are you going to 
have a try for it? 

THE PARLOR MaID. Well, of course youre not in 
earnest, sir. But it does set one thinking, especially 
when one is going to be married. 

conRAD. What has that to do with it? He may live 
as long as you, you know. 

THE PARLOR MAID. ‘That’s just it, sir. You see, he 
must take me for better for worse, til death do us part 
Do you think he would be so ready to do that, sir, if he 
thought it might be for several hundred years? 

conrap. That’s true. And what about yourself? 

THE PARLOR MaIp. Oh, I tell you straight out, sir 
I’d never promise to live with the same man as long a: 
that. I wouldnt put up with my own children as lon 
as that. Why, cook figured it out, sir, that when yot 
were only 200, you might marry your own great-great 
great-great-great-great-grandson and not even knot 


' who he was. 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 51 


conrap. Well, why not? For all you know, the 
man you are going to marry may be your great-great- 
great-great-great-great-grandmother’s great-great- 
great-great-great-great-grandson. 

THE PARLOR mMalIp. But do you think it would ever 
be thought respectable, ‘sir? 

conrap. My good girl, all biological necessities 
have to be made respectable whether we like it or not; so 
you neednt worry yourself about that. 

Franklyn returns and crosses the room to his chair, 
but does not sit down. ‘The parlor maid goes out. 

conrap. Well, what does Joyce Burge want? 

FRANKLYN. Oh, a silly misunderstanding. I have 
promised to address a meeting in Middlesborough; and 
some fool has put it into the papers that I am “coming 
to Middlesborough,” without any explanation. Of 
course, now that we are on the eve of a general election, 
political people think I am coming there to contest the 
parliamentary seat. Burge knows that I have a fol- 
lowing, and thinks I could get into the House of Com- 
mons and head a group there. So he insists on coming 
to see me. He is staying with some people at Dollis 
Hill, and can be here in five or ten minutes, he says. 

conrapv. But didn’t you tell him that it’s a false 
alarm? 

FRANKLYN. Of course I did; but he wont believe me. 

conrap. Called you a liar, in fact? 

FRANKLYN. No: I wish he had: any sort of plain 
speaking is better than the nauseous sham goodfel- 
lowship our democratic public men get up for shop use. 
He pretends to believe me, and assures me his visit is 
quite disinterested; but why should he come if he has no 
axe to grind? These chaps never believe anything they 
say themselves; and naturally they cannot believe any- 
thing anyone else says. 


52 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


conrapD [rising] Well, I shall clear out. It was hard 
enough to stand the party politicians before the war; 
but now that they have managed to half kill Europe 
between them, I cant be civil to them, and I dont see why 
I should be. 

FRANKLYN. Wait a bit. We have to find out how 
the world will take our new gospel. [Conrad sits down 
again]. Party politicians are still unfortunately an 
important part of the world. Suppose we try it on 
Joyce Burge. 

conrap. How can you? You can tell things only 
to people who can listen. Joyce Burge has talked so 
much that he has lost the power of listening. He 
doesnt listen even in the House of Commons. 

Savoy rushes in breathless, followed by Haslam, who 
remains tumidly just inside the door. 

savvy [running to Franklyn] I say! Who do you 
think has just driven up in a big car? 

FRANKLYN. Mr Joyce Burge, perhaps. 

savvy [disappointed] Oh, they know, Bill. Why 
didnt you tell us he was coming? I have nothing on. 

HASLAM. Id better go, hadnt I? 

conrap. You just wait here, both of you. When 
you start yawning, Joyce Burge will take the hint, 
perhaps. 

savvy [to Franklyn] May we? 

FRANKLYN. Yes, if you promise to behave yourself. 

savvy [making a wry face| That will be a treat, 
wont it? 

THE PARLOR MaIp [entering and announcing] Mr 
Joyce Burge. [Haslam hastily moves to the fireplace; 
and the parlor maid goes out and shuts the door when 
the visttor has passed in}. 

FRANKLYN [hurrying past Savoy to his guest with 
the false cordiality he has just been denouncing | Oh! 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 53 


Here you are, Delighted to see you. [He shakes 
Burge’s hand, and introduces Savoy] My daughter. 

savvy [not daring to approach] Very kind of you to 
come. 

Joyce Burge stands fast and says nothing; but he 
screws up his cheeks into a smile at each introduction, 
and makes his eyes shine in a very winning manner. He 
ts a well-fed man turned fifty, with broad forehead, and 
grey hair which, his neck being short, falls almost to his 
collar. 

FRANKLYN. Mr Haslam, our rector, 

Burge conveys an impression of shining like a church 
window; and Haslam seizes the nearest library chair on 
the hearth, and swings it round for Burge between the 
stool and Conrad. He then retires to the window seat at 
the other side of the room, and is joined by Savoy. They 
stt there, side by side, hunched up with their elbows on 
their knees and their chins on their hands, providing 
Burge with a sort of Strangers’ Gallery during the 
ensuing sitting. 

FRANKLYN. I forget whether you know my brother 
Conrad. He is a biologist. 

BURGE [suddenly bursting into energetic action and 
shaking hands heartily with Conrad] By reputation 
only, but very well, of course. How I wish I could have 
devoted myself to biology! I have always been inter- 
ested in rocks and strata and volcanoes and so forth: 
they throw such a light on the age of the earth. [With 
conviction] There is nothing like biology. ‘The cloud- 
capped towers, the solemn pinnacles, the gorgeous 
temples, the great globe itself: yea, all that it inherit 
shall dissolve, and, like this influential pageant faded, 
leave not a rack behind.” That’s biology, you know: 
good sound biology. [He stts down. So do the others, 
Franklyn on the stool, and Conrad on his Chippendale]. 


BA Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


Well, my dear Barnabas, what do you think of the situ- 
ation? Dont you think the time has come for us to 
make a move? 

FRANKLYN. The time has always come to make a 
move. 

BURGE. How true! But what is the move to be? 
You are a man of enormous influence. We know that. 
Weve always known it. We have to consult you whether 
we like it or not. We— * 

FRANKLYN [imterrupting firmly] I never meddle in 
party politics now. 

savvy. It’s no use saying you have no influence, 
daddy. Heaps of people swear by you. 

BURGE [shining at her] Of course they do. Come! 
let me prove to you what we think of you. Shall we find 
you a first-rate constituency to contest at the next elec- 
tion? One that wont cost you a penny. A metropolitan 
seat. What do you say to the Strand? 

FRANKLYN. My dear Burge, I am not a child. Why 
do you go on wasting your party funds on the Strand? 
You know you cannot win it. 

BURGE. We cannot win it; but you— 

FRANKLYN. Oh, please! 

savvy. ‘The Strand’s no use, Mr. Burge. I once 
canvassed for a Socialist there. Cheese it. 

BURGE. Cheese it! 

HasLam [spluttering with suppressed laughter] 
Priceless ! 

savvy. Well, I suppose I shouldnt say cheese it to a 
oe Honorable. But the Strand, you know! Do come 
off it. | 
_ FRANKLYN. You must excuse my daughter’s shock- 
ing manners, Burge; but I agree with her that popular 
democratic statesmen soon come to believe that everyone 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 55 


they speak to is an ignorant dupe and a born fool into 
the bargain. 

BURGE [laughing genially] You old aristocrat, you! 
But believe me, the instinct of the people is sound— 

conkaD [cutting in sharply] Then why are you in 
the Opposition instead of in the Government? 

BURGE [ showing signs of temper under this heckling] 
I deny that I am in the Opposition morally. The 
Government does not represent the country. I was 
chucked out of the Coalition by a Tory conspiracy. 
The people want me back. I dont want to go back. 

FRANKLYN [ gently remonstrant | My dear Burge: of 
course you do. 

BURGE [turning on him] Not a bit of it. I want to 
cultivate my garden. I am not interested in politics: I 
am interested in roses. I havent a scrap of ambition. 
I went into politics because my wife shoved me into 
them, bless her! But I want to serve my country. What 
else am I for? I want to save my country from the 
Tories. They dont represent the people. The man 
they have made Prime Minister has never represented 
the people; and you know it. Lord Dunreen is the bit- 
terest old Tory left alive. What has he to offer to the 
people? 

FRANKLYN [cutting in before Burge can proceed—as 
he evidently intends—to answer his own question] I will 
tell you. He has ascertainable beliefs and principles to 
offer. The people know where they are with Lord Dun- 
reen. They know what he thinks right and what he 
thinks wrong. With your followers they never know 
where they are. With you they never know where 
they are. 

BurcE [amazed] With me! 

FRANKLYN. Well, where are you? What are you? 


56 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


BuRGE. Barnabas: you must be mad. You ask me 
what I am? 

FRANKLYN. I do. 

BuRcE. I am, if I mistake not, Joyce Burge, pretty 
well known throughout Europe, and indeed throughout 
the world, as the man who—unworthily perhaps, but not 
quite unsuccessfully—held the helm when the ship of 
State weathered the mightiest hurricane that has ever 
burst with earth-shaking violence on the land of our 
fathers. 

FRANKLYN. I know that. I know who you are. 
And the earth-shaking part of it to me is that though 
you were placed in that enormously responsible position, 
neither I nor anyone else knows what your beliefs are, 
or even whether you have either beliefs or principles. 
What we did know was that your Government was 
formed largely of men who regarded you as a robber of 
henroosts, and whom you regarded as enemies of the 
people. 

BURGE [adroitly, as he thinks] I agree with you. I 
agree with you absolutely. I dont believe in coalition 
governments. 

FRANKLYN. Precisely. Yet you formed two. 

BuRGE. Why? Because we were at war. That is 
what you fellows never would realize. The Hun was at 
the gate. Our country, our lives, the honor of our 
wives and mothers and daughters, the tender flesh of our 
innocent babes, were at stake. Was that a time to argue 
about principles? 

FRANKLYN. I should say it was the time of all others 
to confirm the resolution of our own men and gain the 
confidence and support of public opinion throughout the 
world by a declaration of principle. Do you think the 
Hun would ever have come to the gate if he had known 
that it would be shut in his face on principle? Did he 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 57. 


not hold his own against you until America boldly 
affirmed the democratic principle and came to our 
rescue? Why did you let America snatch that honor 
from England? 

BURGE. Barnabas: America was carried away by 
words, and had to eat them at the Peace Conference. 
Beware of eloquence: it is the bane of popular speakers 
like you. 

FRANKLYN ([exclaiming| Well! ! 

SAVVY 4 all + T like that! 

Hastam | together] J Priceless! 

BURGE [continuing remorselessly] Come down to 
facts. It wasnt principle that won the war: it was the | 
British fleet and the blockade. America found the talk: 
I found the shells. You cannot win wars by principles; 
but you can win elections by them. There I am with 
you. You want the next election to be fought on prin-— 
ciples: that is what it comes to, doesnt it? 

FRANKLYN. I dont want it to be fought at all? An 
election is a moral horror, as bad as a battle except for. 
the blood: a mud bath for every soul concerned in it. 
You know very well that it will not be fought on 
principle. , 

BURGE. On the contrary it will be fought on nothing 
else. I believe a program is a mistake. I agree with 
you that principle is what we want. 

FRANKLYN. Principle without program, eh? 

BuRGE. Exactly. There it is in three words. 

FRANKLYN. Why not in one word?  Platitudes. 
That is what principle without program means. 

BURGE [ puzzled but patrent, trying to get at Frank- 
lyn’s drift im order to ascertain his price} I have not 
made myself clear. Listen. I am agreeing with you. 
I am on your side. I am accepting your proposal. 
There isnt going to be any more coalition. ‘This time 


58 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


there wont be a Tory in the Cabinet. Every candidate 
will have to pledge himself to Free Trade, slightly 
modified by consideration for our Overseas Dominions ; 
to Disestablishment; to Reform of the House of Lords; 
to a revised scheme of Taxation of Land Values; and to 
doing something or other to keep the Irish quiet. Does 
that satisfy you? 

FRANKLYN. It does not even interest me. Suppose 
your friends do commit themselves to all this! What 
does it prove about them except that they are hopelessly 
out of date even in party politics? that they have learnt 
nothing and forgotten nothing since 1885? What is it 
to me that they hate the Church and hate the landed 
gentry; that they are jealous of the nobility, and have 
shipping shares instead of manufacturing businesses in 
the Midlands? I can find you hundreds of the most 
sordid rascals, or the most densely stupid reactionaries, 
with all these qualifications. 

BURGE. Personal abuse proves nothing. Do you 
suppose the Tories are all angels because they are all 
members of the Church of England? 

FRANKLYN. No; but they stand together as members 
of the Church of England, whereas your people, in 
attacking the Church, are all over the shop. The sup- 
porters of the Church are of one mind about religion: 
Its enemies are of a dozen minds. The Churchmen are 
a phalanx: your people are a mob in which atheists are 
jostled by Plymouth Brethren, and Positivists by Pillars 
of Fire. You have with you all the crudest unbelievers 
and all the crudest fanatics. 

BURGE. We stand, as Cromwell did, for liberty of 
conscience, if that is what you mean. 

FRANKLYN. How ean you talk such rubbish over the 
graves of your conscientious objectors? All law limits 
liberty of conscience: if a man’s conscience allows him to 


fartil Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 39 


steal your watch or to shirk military service, how much 
cee do you allow it? Liberty of conscience is not my 
point. 

BURGE | testily] I wish you would come to your point. 
Half the time you are saying that you must have prin- 
ciples; and when I offer you principles you say they 
wont work. 

FRANKLYN. You have not offered me any principles. 
Your party shibboleths are not principles. If you get 
into power again you will find yourself at the head of a 
rabble of Socialists and anti-Socialists, of Jingo Im- 
perialists and Little Englanders, of cast-iron Material- 
ists and ecstatic Quakers, of Christian Scientists and 
Compulsory Inoculationists, of Syndicalists and Bureau- 
crats: in short, of men differing fiercely and irreconcil- 
ably on every principle that goes to the root of human 
society and destiny; and the impossibility of keeping 
such a team together will force you to sell the pass again 
to the solid Conservative Opposition. 

BuRGE [rising in wrath] Sell the pass again! You 
accuse me of having sold the pass! 

FRANKLYN. When the terrible impact of real war- 
fare swept your parliamentary sham warfare into the 
dustbin, you had to go behind the backs of your fol- 
lowers and make a secret agreement with the leaders of 
the Opposition party to keep you in power on condition 
that you dropped all legislation of which they did not 
approve. And you could not even hold them to their 
bargain; for they presently betrayed the secret and 
forced the coalition on you. 

purcE. I solemnly declare that this is a false and 
monstrous accusation. 

FRANKLYN. Do you deny that the thing occurred? 
Were the uncontradicted reports false? Were the pub- 
lished letters forgeries? 


a ns ae 


60 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


BuRrcE. Certainly not. But J did not do it. I was 
not Prime Minister then. It was that old dotard, that 
played-out old humbug Lubin. He was Prime Minister 
then, not J. 

FRANKLYN. Do you mean to say you did not know? 

BURGE [sitting down again with a shrug] Oh, I had 
to be told. But what could I do? If we had refused we 
might have had to go out of office. 

FRANKLYN. Precisely. 

BuRGE. Well, could we desert the country at such a 
crisis? ‘The Hun was at the gate. Everyone has to 
make a sacrifice for the sake of the country at such 
moments. We had to rise above party; and I am proud 
to say we never gave party a second thought. We 
stuck to— 

conraD. Office? 

BURGE [turning on him] Yes, sir, to office: that is, to 
responsibility, to danger, to heart-sickening toil, to 
abuse and misunderstanding, to a martyrdom that made 
us envy the very soldiers in the trenches. If you had 
had to live for months on aspirin and bromide of potas- 
slum to get a wink of sleep, you wouldnt talk about 
office as if it were a catch. 

FRANKLYN. Still, you admit that under our parlia- 
mentary system Lubin could not have helped himself ? 

BURGE. On that subject my lips are closed. Nothing 
will induce me to say one word against the old man. I 
never have; and J never will. Lubin is old: he has never 
been a real statesman: he is as lazy as a cat on a hearth- 
rug: you cant get him to attend to anything; he is good 
for nothing but getting up and making speeches with a 
peroration that goes down with the back benches. But 
I say nothing against him. I gather that you do not 
think much of me as a statesman: but at all events ] can 


rartit rUspel OL the Krothers Barnabas 61 


get things done. I can hustle: even you will admit that. 
But Lubin! Oh my stars, Lubin! ! If you only knew— 

The parlor maid opens the door and announces a 
visitor. 

THE PARLOR Map. Mr. Lubin. 

BURGE | bounding from his chair] Lubin! Is this a 
conspiracy ? 

They all rise im amazement, staring at the door. 
Lubin enters: a man at the end of his sixties, a York- 
shireman with the last traces of Scandinavian flax still 
in his white hair, undistinguished in stature, unassum- 
ing in his manner, and taking his simple dignity for 
granted, but wonderfully comfortable and quite self- 
assured in contrast to the intellectual restlessness of 
Franklyn and the mesmeric self-assertiveness of Burge. 
His presence suddenly brings out the fact that they are 
unhappy men, ill at ease, square pegs im round holes, 
whilst he flourishes like a primrose. 

The parlor maid withdraws. 

LuBIN [coming to Franklyn] How do you do, Mr 
Barnabas? [He speaks very comfortably and kindly, 
much as tf he were the host, and Franklyn an embar- 
rassed but welcome guest|. I had the pleasure of meet- 
ing you once at the Mansion House. I think it was to 
celebrate the conclusion of the hundred years peace with 
America. 

FRANKLYN | shaking hands| It was long before that: 
a meeting about Venezuela, when we were on the point of 
going to war with America. rare 

LUBIN [not at all put out] Yes: you are quite right. 
I knew it was something about America. [He pats 
Franklyn’s hand]. And how have you been all this 
time? Well, eh? 

FRANKLYN [smiling fo soften the sarcasm] A few 
vicissitude of health naturally in so long a time, 


62 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


LUBIN. Just so. Just so. [Looking round at 
Savvy] The young lady is—? 

FRANKLYN, My daughter, Savvy. 

Savoy comes from the window between her father and 
Lubin. 

LuBIn [taking her hand affectionately in both his] 
And why has she never come to see us? 

suRGE. I dont know whether you have noticed, 
Lubin, that I am present. 

Savoy takes advantage of this diversion to slip away 
to the settee, where she is stealthily joined by Haslam, 
who sits down on her left. 

LUBIN [seating himself n Burge’s chair with ineffable 
comfortableness| My dear Burge: if you imagine that 
it is possible to be within ten miles of your energetic 
presence without being acutely aware of it, you do your- 
self the greatest injustice. How are you? And how 
are your good newspaper friends? [Burge makes an 
explosive movement; but Lubin goes on calmly and 
sweetly] And what are you doing here with my old 
friend Barnabas, if I may ask? 

BURGE | sitteng down in Conrad’s chair, leaving him 
standing uneasily in the corner] Well, just what you 
are doing, if you want to know. I am trying to enlist 
Mr Barnabas’s valuable support for my party. 

LUBIN. Your party, eh? The newspaper party? 

Bsurce. The Liberal Party. The party of which I 
have the honor to be leader. 

LUBIN. Have you now? Thats very interesting; for 
I thought I was the leader of the Liberal Party. How- 
ever, it is very kind of you to take it off my hands, if 
the party will let you. 

BuRGE. Do you suggest that I have not the support 
and confidence of the party? 

LuBIN. I dont suggest anything, my dear Burge. 


Partll ospel of the Brothers Barnabas 63 


Mr Barnabas will tell you that we all think very highly 
of you. The country owes you a great deal. During 
the war, you did very creditably over the munitions; and 
if you were not quite so successful with the peace, no- 
body doubted that you meant well. 

BURGE. Very kind of you, Lubin. Let me remark 
that you cannot lead a progressive party without get- 
ting a move on. 

LUBIN. You mean you cannot. I did it for ten 
years without the least difficulty. And very comfortable, 
prosperous, pleasant years they were. 

BURGE. Yes; but what did they end in? 

LuBIN. In you, Burge. You dont complain of that, 
do you? 

BURGE [fiercely] In plague, pestilence, and famine; 
battle, murder, and sudden death. 

LUBIN [with an appreciative chuckle] The Noncon- 
formist can quote the prayer-book for his own purposes, 
I see. How you enjoyed yourself over that business, 
Burge! Do you remember the Knock-Out Blow? 

BURGE. It came off: dont forget that. Do you re- 
member fighting to the last drop of your blood? 

LUBIN [unruffled, to Franklyn] By the way, I remem- 
ber your brother Conrad—a wonderful brain and a dear 
good fellow—explaining to me that I couldnt fight to the 
last drop of my blood, because I should be dead long 
before I came to it. Most interesting, and quite true. 
He was introduced to me at a meeting where the suf- 
fragettes kept disturbing me. They had to be carried 
out kicking and making a horrid disturbance. 

conrap. No: it was later, at a meeting to support 
the Franchise Bill which gave them the vote. 

Lusin [discovermg Conrad’s presence for the first 
time] Youre right: it was. I knew it had something 
to do with women. My memory never deceives me. 


64 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


Thank you. Will you introduce me to this gentleman, 
Barnabas? 

conrap [not at all affably] I am the Conrad in ques- 
tion. [He sits down in dudgeon on the vacant Chippen- 
dale |. 

he Are you? [Looking at him pleasantly] 
Yes: of course you are. I never forget a face. But 
[with an arch turn of his eyes to Savvy] your pretty 
niece engaged all my powers of vision. 

BURGE. I wish youd be serious, Lubin. God knows 
we have passed through times terrible enough to make 
any man serious. 

tuBin. I do not think I need to be reminded of that. 
In peace time I used to keep myself fresh for my work 
by banishing all worldly considerations from my mind 
on Sundays; but war has no respect for the Sabbath; 
and there have been Sundays within the last few years 
on which I had to play as many as sixty-six games of 
bridge to keep my mind off the news from the front. 

BURGE [scandalized| Sixty-six games of bridge on 
Sunday! !! 

LUBIN. You probably sang sixty-six hymns. But as 
I cannot boast either your admirable voice or your 
spiritual fervor, I had to fall back on bridge. 

FRANKLYN. If I may go back to the subject of your 
visit, it seems to me that you may both be completely 
superseded by the Labor Party. 

BURGE. But I am in the truest sense myself a Labor 
leader. I— [he stops, as Lubin has risen with a half- 
suppressed yawn, and is already talking calmly, but 
without a pretence of interest]. 

LuBIN. The Labor Party! Oh no, Mr Barnabas. 
No, no, no, no, no. [He moves in Savoy's direction]. 
There will be no trouble about that. Of course we must 
give them a few seats: more, I quite admit, than we 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 65 


should have dreamt of leaving to them before the war; 
but— [by this time he has reached the sofa where Savvy 
and Haslam are seated. He sits down between them; 
takes her hand; and drops the subject of Labor]. Well, 
my dear young lady? What is the latest news? Whats 
going on? Have you seen Shoddy’s new play? Tell 
me all about it, and all about the latest books, and all 
about everything. | 
savvy. You have not met Mr Haslam. Our Rector. 

LuBIN [who has quite overlooked Haslam] Never 
heard of him. Is he any good? 

FRANKLYN. I was introducing him. This is Mr 
Haslam. 

HASLAM. How d’ye do! 

LuBIN. I beg your pardon, Mr Haslam. Delighted 
to meet you. [7J'o Savvy] Well, now, how many books 
have you written? 

savvy [rather overwhelmed but attracted] None. I 
dont write. 

LuBIN. You dont say so! Well, what do you do? 
Music? Skirt-dancing? 

savvy. I dont do anything. 

tuBin. ‘Thank God! You and I were born for one 
another. Who is your favorite poet, Sally? 

SAVVY. Savvy. 

Lupin. Savvy! I never heard of him. Tell me all 
about him. Keep me up to date. 

savvy. It’s not a poet. I am Savvy, not Sally. 

LuBin. Savvy! Thats a funny name, and very 
pretty. Savvy. It sounds Chinese. What does it 
mean? 

conrap. Short for Savage. 

LuBIN [patting her hand] La belle Sauvage. 

wasLaM [rising and surrendermg Savoy to Lubin by

crossing to the fireplace] I suppose the Church is out of 
it as far as progressive politics are concerned. 

BuRcE. Nonsense! ‘That notion about the Church 
being unprogressive is one of those shibboleths that our 
party must drop. The Church is all right essentially. 
Get rid of the establishment; get rid of the bishops; get 
rid of the candlesticks; get rid of the 39 articles; and 
the Church of England is just as good as any other 
Church; and I dont care who hears me say so. 

LuBIN. It doesnt matter a bit who hears you say so, 
my dear Burge. [T’o Savvy] Who did you say your 
favorite poet was? 

savvy. I dont make pets of poets. Who’s yours? 

LUBIN. Horace. 

savvy. Horace who? 

LUBIN. Quintus MHoratius Flaccus: the noblest 
Roman of them all, my dear. 

savvy. Oh, if he is dead, that explains it. I have a 
theory that all the dead people we feel especially inter- 
ested in must have been ourselves. You must be Horace’s 
reincarnation. 

LuBIN [delighted] 'That is the very most charming 
and penetrating and intelligent thing that has ever been 
said to me. Barnabas: will you exchange daughters 
with me? I can give you your choice of two. 

FRANKLYN. Man proposes. Savvy disposes. 

LuBin. What does Savvy say? 

nuRGE. Lubin: I came here to talk politics. 

LuBIN. Yes: you have only one subject, Burge. I 
came here to talk to Savvy. Take Burge into the next 
room, Barnabas; and let him rip. 

BURGE [half-angrily, half-indulgent| No; but really, 
Lubin, we are at a crisis— 

tuBin. My dear Burge, life is a disease: and the 
only difference between one man and another is the stage 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 67 


of the disease at which he lives. You are always at the 
crisis: I am always in the convalescent stage. I enjoy 
convalescence. It is the part that makes the illness 
worth while, 

savvy [half-rising] Perhaps I’d better run away. I 
am distracting you. 

LUBIN [making her sit down again] Not at all, my 
dear. You are only distracting Burge. Jolly good 
thing for him to be distracted by a pretty girl. Just 
what he needs. 

BurGE. I sometimes envy you, Lubin. The great 
movement of mankind, the giant sweep of the ages, 
‘passes you by and leaves you standing. 

LUBIN. It leaves me sitting, and quite comfortable, 
thank you. Go on sweeping. When you are tired of it, 
come back; and you will find England where it was, and 
me in my accustomed place, with Miss Savvy telling me 
all sorts of interesting things. 

savvy [who has been growing more and more restless | 
Dont let him shut you up, Mr Burge. You know, Mr 
Lubin, I am frightfully interested in the Labor move- 
ment, and in Theosophy, and in reconstruction after the 
war, and all sorts of things. I daresay the flappers in 
your smart set are tremendously flattered when you sit 
beside them and are nice to them as you are being nice 
to me; but I am not smart; and I am no use as a flapper. 
I am dowdy and serious. I want you to be serious. If 
you refuse, I shall go and sit beside Mr Burge, and ask 
him to hold my hand. 

LuBiIn. He wouldnt know how to do it, my dear. 
Burge has a reputation as a profligate— 

BuRcE [starting] Lubin: this is monstrous. I— 

Lunin [continuing] —but he is really a model of 
domesticity. His name is coupled with all the most 
celebrated beauties; but for him there is only one 


68 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part IT 


woman; ‘and that is not you, my dear, but his very 
charming wife. 

BURGE. You are destroying my character in the act 
of pretending to save it. Have the goodness to confine 
yourself to your own character and your own wife. 
Both of them need all your attention. 

LusIn. I have the privilege of my age and of my 
transparent innocence. I have not to struggle with your 
volcanic energy. 

BuRGE [with an immense sense of power] No, by 
George! 

FRANKLYN. I think I shall speak both for my brother 
and myself, and possibly also for my daughter, if I say 
that since the object of your visit and Mr Joyce Burge’s 
is to some extent political, we should hear with great 
interest something about your political aims, Mr Lubin. 

LUBIN [assenting with complete good humor, and be- 
coming attentive, clear, and businesslike in his tone] By 
all means, Mr Barnabas. What we have to consider 
first, I take it, is what prospect there is of our finding 
you beside us in the House after the next election. 

FRANKLYN. When I speak of politics, Mr Lubin, I 
am not thinking of elections, or available seats, or party 
funds, or the registers, or even, I am sorry to have to 
add, of parliament as it exists at present. I had much 
rather you talked about bridge than about electioneer- 
ing: it is the more interesting game of the two. 

BURGE. He wants to discuss principles, Lubin. 

LuBIn [very cool and clear| I understand Mr Bar- 
nabas quite well. But elections are unsettled things: 
principles are settled things. 

conraD [impatiently] Great Heavens !— 

LuBIN [interrupting him with quiet authority] One 
moment, Dr Barnabas. The main principles on which 
modern civilized society is founded are pretty well 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 69 


understood among educated people. That is what our 
dangerously half-educated masses and their pet—dema- 
gogues—if Burge will excuse that expression— 

BURGE. Dont mind me. Go on. I shall have some- 
thing to say presently. 

LuBIN. —that is what our dangerously half-edu- 
cated people do not realize. Take all this fuss about 
the Labor Party, with its imaginary new principles and 
new politics. The Labor members will find that the im- 
mutable laws of political economy take no more notice 
of their ambitions and aspirations than the law of gravi- 
tation. I speak, if I may say so, with knowledge; for I 
have made a special study of the Labor question. 

FRANLYN [with interest and some surprise| Indeed? 

LuBiIn. Yes. It occurred quite at the beginning of 
my career. I was asked to deliver an address to the 
students at the Working Men’s College; and I was 
strongly advised to comply, as Gladstone and Morley 
and others were doing that sort of thing at the moment. 
It was rather a troublesome job, because I had not gone 
into political economy at the time. As you know, at the 
university I was a classical scholar; and my profession 
was the Law. But I looked up the text-books, and got 
up the case most carefully. I found that the correct 
view is that all this Trade Unionism and Socialism and 
so forth is founded on the ignorant delusion that wages 
and the production and distribution of wealth can be 
controlled by legislation or by any human action what- 
ever. hey obey fixed scientific laws, which have been 
ascertained and settled finally by the highest economic 
authorities. Naturally I do not at this distance of time 
remember the exact process of reasoning; but I can get 
up the case again at any time in a couple of days; and 
you may rely on me absolutely, should the occasion 
arise, to deal with all these ignorant and unpractical 


70 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


people in a conclusive and convincing way, except, of 
course, as far as it may be advisable to indulge and flat- 
ter them a little so as to let them down without creating 
ill feeling in the working-class electorate. In short, I 
can get that lecture up again almost at a moment’s 
notice. 

savvy. But, Mr Lubin, I have had a university edu- 
cation too; and all this about wages and distribution 
being fixed by immutable laws of political economy is 
obsolete rot. 

FRANKLYN [shocked] Oh, my dear! That is not 
polite. 

LuBIN. No, no, no. Dont scold her. She mustnt be 
scolded. [J'o Savvy] I understand. You are a disciple 
of Karl Marx. 

savvy. No, no. Karl Marx’s economies are all rot. 

LUBIN [at last a little taken aback | Dear me! 

Savvy. You must excuse me, Mr Lubin; but it’s like 
hearing a man talk about the Garden of Eden. 

conrap. Why shouldnt he talk about the Garden of 
Eden? It was a first attempt at biology anyhow. 

LUBIN [recovering his self-possesston | I am sound on 
the Garden of Eden. I have heard of Darwin. 

savvy. But Darwin is all rot. 

tuBin. What! Already! 

savvy. It’s no good your smiling at me like a 
Cheshire cat, Mr Lubin; and I am not going to sit here 
mumchance like an old-fashioned goody-goody wife 
while you men monopolize the conversation and pay out 
the very ghastliest exploded drivel as the latest thing in 
politics. I am not giving you my own ideas, Mr Lubin, 
but just the regular orthodox science of to-day. Only 
the most awful old fossils think that Socialism is bad 
economics and that Darwin invented Evolution. Ask 
Papa. Ask Uncle. Ask the first person you meet in the 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 71 


street. [She rises and crosses to Haslam]. Give mea 
cigaret, Bill, will you? 

HASLAM. Priceless. [He complies]. 

FRANKLYN. Savvy has not lived long enough to have 
any manners, Mr Lubin; but that is where you stand 
with the younger generation. Dont smoke, dear. 

Savoy, with a shrug of rather mutinous resignation, 
throws the cigaret into the fire. Haslam, on the powt 
of lighting one for himself, changes his mind. 

LuBIN [shrewd and serious] Mr Barnabas: I confess 
I am surprised; and I will not pretend that I am con- 
vinced. But I am open to conviction. I may be wrong. 

BURGE [in a burst of irony] Ohno. Impossible! Im- 
possible! 

LuBin. Yes, Mr Barnabas, though I do not possess 
Burge’s genius for being always wrong, I have been in 
that position once or twice. I could not conceal from 
you, even if I wished to, that my time has been so com- 
pletely filled by my professional work as a lawyer, and 
later on by my duties as leader of the House of Com- 
mons in the days when Prime Ministers were also 
leaders— | 

purcE [stung] Not to mention bridge and smart 
society. 

LUBIN. —not to mention the continual and trying 
effort to make Burge behave himself, that I have not 
been able to keep my academic reading up to date. I 
have kept my classics brushed up out of sheer love for 
them; but my economics and my science, such as they 
were, may possibly be a little rusty. Yet I think I may 
say that if you and your brother will be so good as to 
put me on the track of the necessary documents, I will 
undertake to put the case to the House or to the country 
to your entire satisfaction. You see, as long as you 
can shew these troublesome half-educated people who 


72 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


want to turn the world upside down that they are talk- 
ing nonsense, it really does not matter very much 
whether you do it in terms of what Miss Barnabas calls 
obsolete rot or in terms of what her granddaughter will 
probably call unmitigated tosh. I have no objection 
whatever to denounce Karl Marx. Anything I can say 
against Darwin will please a large body of sincerely 
pious voters. If it will be easier to carry on the busi- 
ness of the country on the understanding that the 
present state of things is to be called Socialism, I have 
no objection in the world to call it Socialism. There is 
the precedent of the Emperor Constantine, who saved 
the society of his own day by agreeing to call his Im- 
perialism Christianity. Mind: I must not go ahead of 
the electorate. You must not call a voter a Socialist 
until— 

FRANKLYN. Until he is a Socialist. Agreed. 

LUBIN. Oh, not at all. You need not wait for that. 
You must not call him a Socialist until he wishes to be 
valled a Socialist: that is all. Surely you would not say 
that I must not address my constituents as gentlemen 
until they are gentlemen. I address them as gentlemen 
because they wish to be so addressed. [He rises from 
the sofa and goes to Franklyn, placing a reassuring 
hand on his shoulder|. Do not be afraid of Socialism, 
Mr Barnabas. You need not tremble for your property 
or your position or your dignity. England will remain 
what England is, no matter what new political names 
may come into vogue. I do not intend to resist the 
transition to Socialism. You may depend on me to guide 
it, to lead it, to give suitable expression to its aspira- 
tions, and to steer it clear of Utopian absurdities. T can 
honestly ask for your support on the most advanced 
Socialist grounds no less than on the soundest Liberal 
ones, 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 73 


_ BuRcE. In short, Lubin, youre incorrigible. You 
dont believe anything is going to change. The millions 
are still to toil—the people—my people—for I am a 
man of the people— 

LUBIN [interrupting him contemptuously] Dont be 
ridiculous, Burge. You are a country solicitor, further 
removed from the people, more foreign to them, more 
jealous of letting them up to your level, than any duke 
or any archbishop. 

BURGE [hotly] I deny it. You think I have never been 
poor. You think I have never cleaned my own boots. 
You think my fingers have never come out through the 
soles when I was cleaning them. You think— 

tuBin. I think you fall into the very common mis- 
take of supposing that it is poverty that makes the 
proletarian and money that makes the gentleman. You 
are quite wrong. You never belonged to the people: 
you belonged to the impecunious. Impecuniosity and 
broken boots are the lot of the unsuccessful middle class, 
and the commonplaces of the early struggles of the pro- 
fessional and younger son class. I defy you to find a 
farm laborer m England with broken boots. Call a 
mechanic one of the poor, and he’ll punch your head. 
When you talk to your constituents about the toiling 
millions, they dont consider that you are referring to 
them. ‘They are all third cousins of somebody with a 
title or a park. I-am a Yorkshireman, my friend. I 
know England; and you dont. If you did you would 
know— 

BurcE. What do you know that I don’t know? 

tusin. I know that we are taking up too much of 
Mr. Barnabas’s time. [Franklyn rises]. May I take it. 
my dear Barnabas, that I may count on your support if 
we succeed in forcing an election before the new register 
4s in full working order? 


ppcetaas os 


74 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


BURGE [rising also] May the party count on your 
support? I say nothing about myself. Can the party 
depend on you? Is there any question of yours that I 
have left unanswered? 

conrap. We havent asked you any, you know. 

BuRGE. ‘May I take that as a mark of confidence? 

conraD. If I were a laborer in your constituency, I 
should ask you a biological question? 

tuBIN. No you wouldnt, my dear Doctor. Laborers 
never ask questions. 

BuRGE. Ask it now. I have never flinched from 
being heckled. Out with it. Is it about the land? 

conraD. No. 

BuRGE. Is it about the Church? 

conrAD. No. 

BuRGE. Is it about the House of Lords? 

conrad. No. 

BuRGE. Is it about Proportional Representation?

BURGE. Is it about Germany? 

conrap. No. 

BURGE. Well, is it about Republicanism? Come! I 
wont flinch. Is it about the Monarchy? 

conrap. No. 

BuRGE. Well, what the devil is it about, then? 

conrap. You understand that I am asking the ques- 
tion in the character of a laborer who earned thirteen 
shillings a week before the war and earns thirty now, 
when he can get it? 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 75 


BuRGE. Yes: ] understand that. I am ready for you. 
_ Out with it. 

conrgap. And whom you propose to represent in 
parliament? 

BURGE. Yes, yes, yes. Come on. 

congaD. ‘The question is this. Would you allow 
your son to marry my daughter, or your daughter to 
marry my son? 

BURGE | taken aback | Oh, come! Thats not a politi- 
cal question. 

congap. Then, as a biologist, I dont take the slight- 
est interest in your politics! and I shall not walk across 
the street to vote for you or anyone else at the election. 
Good evening. 

LUBIN. Serve you right, Burge! Dr Barnabas: you 
have my assurance that my daughter shall marry the 
man of her choice, whether he be lord or laborer. May, 
I count on your support? 

BURGE [hurling the epithet at him] Humbug! 

savvy. Stop. [They all stop short im the movement 
of leavetaking to look at her |. Daddy: are you going 
to let them off like this? How are they to know any- 
thing if nobody ever tells them? If you dont, I will. 

conrap. You cant. You didnt read my book; and 
you know nothing about it. You just hold your tongue. 

savvy. I just wont, Nunk. I shall have a vote when 
I am thirty; and I ought to have it now. Why are 
these two ridiculous people to be allowed to come in and 
walk over us as if the world existed only to play their 
silly parliamentary game? 

es aaa Savvy: you really must not be 
uncivil to our guests. 

savvy. I’m sorry. But Mr Lubin didnt stand on 
much ceremony with me, did he? And Mr Burge hasnt 
addressed a single word to me. I’m not going to stand 


76 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


it. You and Nunk have a much better program than 
either of them. It’s the only one we are going to vote 
for; and they ought to be told about it for the credit of 
the family and the good of their own souls. You just 
tip them a chapter from the gospel of the brothers Bar- 
nabas, Daddy. 

Lubin and Burge turn enquiringly to Franklyn, 
suspecting a move to form a new party. 

FRANKLYN. It is quite true, Mr Lubin, that I and 
my brother have a little program of our own which— 

conrap [interrupting | It’s not a little program: it’s 
an almighty big one. It’s not our own: it’s the program 
of the whole of civilization. 

BurcE. Then why split the party before you have 
put it to us? For God’s sake let us have no more splits. 
I am here to learn. I am here to gather your opinions 
and represent them. I invite you to put your views 
before me. I offer myself to be heckled. You have 
asked me only an absurd non-political question. 

FRANKLYN. Candidly, I fear our program will be 
thrown away on you. It would not interest you. 

BURGE | with challenging audacity| Try. Lubin can 
go if he likes; but I am still open to new ideas, if only I 
can find them. 

FRANKLYN [to Lubin] Are you prepared to listen, 
Mr Lubin; or shall I thank you for your very kind and 
welcome visit, and say good evening? 

LUBIN | sitting down resignedly on the settee, but in- 
voluntarily making a movement which looks like the 
stifling of a yawn] With pleasure, Mr Barnabas. Of 
course you know that before I can adopt any new plank 
in the party platform, it will have to reach me through 
the National Liberal Federation, which you can ap- 


proach through your local Liberal and Radical Asso- 
ciation. 


PartIZ Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 77 


FRANKLYN. I could recall to you several instances of 
the addition to your party program of measures of 
which no local branch of your Federation had ever 
dreamt. But I understand that you are not really inter- 
ested. I will spare you, and drop the subject. 

LUBIN [waking up a little] You quite misunderstand 
me. Please do not take it in that way. I only— 

BurcE [talking him down] Never mind the Federa- 
tion: J will answer for the Federation. Go on, Bar- 
nabas: go on. Never mind Lubin [he sits down in the 
chair from which Lubin first displaced him]. 

FRANKLYN. Our program is only that the term of 
human life shall be extended to three hundred years. 

LuBIN [softly] Eh? 

BURGE [explosively] What! 

savvy. Our election cry is “Back to Methuselah!” 

HASLAM. Priceless! 

Lubin and Burge look at one another. 

congAD. No. We are not mad. 

savvy. ‘Theyre not joking either. They mean it. 

LUBIN [cautiously] Assuming that, in some sense 
which I am for the moment unable to fathom, you are in 
earnest, Mr Barnabas, may I ask what this has to do 
with politics? 

FRANKLYN. ‘The connexion is very evident. You are 
now, Mr Lubin, within immediate reach of your 
seventieth year. Mr Joyce Burge is your junior by 
about eleven years. You will go down to posterity as 
one of a European group of immature statesmen and 
monarchs who, doing the very best for your respective 
countries of which you were capable, succeeded in all- 
but-wrecking the civilization of Europe, and did, in 
effect, wipe out of existence many billions of its in- 
habitants. 

BuRGE. Less than a million. 


\ 


78 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


FRANKLYN. That was our loss alone. 

BURGE. Oh, if you count foreigners—! 

HasLaAM. God counts foreigners, you know. 

savvy [with intense satisfaction] Well said, Bill. 

FRANKLYN. J am not blaming you. Your task was 
beyond human capacity. What with our huge arma- 
ments, our terrible engines of destruction, our systems 
of coercion manned by an irresistible police, you were 
called on to control powers so gigantic that one shudders 
at the thought of their being entrusted even to an in- 
finitely experienced and benevolent God, much less to 
mortal men whose whole life does not last a hundred 
years. 

BuRGE. We won the war: dont forget that. 

FRANKLYN. No: the soldiers and sailors won it, and 
left you to finish it. And you were so utterly incom- 
petent that the multitudes of children slain by hunger 
in the first years of peace made us all wish we were at 
War again. 

-conrap. It’s no use arguing about it. It is now 
absolutely certain that the political and social problems 
raised by our civilization cannot be solved by mere 
human mushrooms who decay and die when they are just 
beginning to have a glimmer of the wisdom and knowl- 


._. edge needed for their own government. 


LUBIN. Quite an interesting idea, Doctor. Extrava- 
gant. Fantastic. But quite interesting. When I was 
young I used to feel my human limitations very acutely. 

BuRGE. God knows I have often felt that I could not 
go on if it had not been for the sense that I was only an 
instrument in the hands of a Power above us. 

conzaD. Tm glad you both agree with us, and with 
one another. 


LuBIN. I have not gone so far as that, I think. 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 79 


After all, we have had many very able political leaders 
even within your recollection and mine. 

FRANKLYN. Have you read the recent biographies— 
Dilke’s, for instance—which revealed the truth about 
them? 

LuBIN. I did not discover any new truth revealed in 
these books, Mr Barnabas. 

FRANKLYN. What! Not the truth that England was 
governed all that time by a little woman who knew her 
own mind? 

savvy. Hear, hear! 

LuBIN. That often happens. Which woman do you 
mean? 

FRANKLYN. Queen Victoria, to whom your Prime 
Ministers stood in the relation of naughty children 
whose heads she knocked together when their tempers 
and quarrels became intolerable. Within thirteen years 
of her death Europe became a hell. 

BURGE. Quite true. That was because she was 
piously brought up, and regarded herself as an instru- 
ment. If a statesman remembers that he is only an 
instrument, and feels quite sure that he is rightly inter- 
preting the divine purpose, he will come out all right, 
you know. 

FRANKLYN. ‘The Kaiser felt like that. Did he come 
out all right? 

BURGE. Well, let us be fair, even to the Kaiser. Let 
us be fair. 

FRANKLYN. Were you fair to him when you won an 
election on the program of hanging him? 

purcE. Stuff! I am the last man alive to hang any- 
body ; but the people wouldnt listen to reason. Besides, 
I knew the Dutch wouldnt give him up. 

savvy. Oh, dont start arguing about poor old Bill. 
Stick to our point. Let these two gentlemen settle the 


80 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


question for themselves. Mr Burge: do you think Mr 
Lubin is fit to govern England? 

purcE. No. Frankly, I dont. 

LuBiIn [remonstrant] Really! 

conrap. Why? 

BuRGE. Because he has no conscience: thats why. 

LuBIN [shocked and amazed| Oh! 

FRANKLYN. Mr Lubin: do you consider Joyce Burge 
qualified to govern England? 

LUBIN [with dignified emotion, wounded, but without 
bitterness| Excuse me, Mr Barnabas; but before I 
answer that question I want to say this. Burge: we have 
had differences of opinion; and your newspaper friends 
have said hard things of me. But we worked together 
for years; and I hope I have done nothing to justify 
you in the amazing accusation you have just brought 
against me. Do you realize that you said that I have 
no conscience? 

BuRGE. Lubin: I am very accessible to an appeal to 
my emotions; and you are very cunning in making such 
appeals. I will meet you to this extent. I dont mean 
that you are a bad man. I dont mean that I dislike you, 
in spite of your continual attempts to discourage and 
depress me. But you have a mind like a looking-glass, 
‘You are very clear and smooth and lucid as to what is 
standing in front of you. But you have no foresight 
and no hindsight. You have no vision and no memory. 
You have no continuity; and a man without continuity 
can have neither conscience nor honor from one day to 
another. The result is that yau have always been a 
damned bad minister; and you have sometimes been a 
damned bad friend. Now you can answer Barnabas’ 
question and take it out of me to your heart’s content. 
He asked you was I fit to govern England. 

Lusin [recovering himself] After what has just 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 81 


passed I sincerely wish I could honestly say yes, Burge. 
But it seems to me that you have condemned yourself 
out of your own mouth. You represent something 
which has had too much influence and popularity in this 
country since Joseph Chamberlain set the fashion; and 
that is mere energy without intellect and without knowl- 
edge. Your mind is not a trained mind: it has not been 
stored with the best information, nor cultivated by 
intercourse with educated minds at any of our great 
seats of learning. As I happen to have enjoyed that 
advantage, it follows that you do not understand my 
mind, Candidly, I think that disqualifies you. The 
peace found out your weaknesses. 

purcGE. Oh! What did it find out in you? 

Lupin. You and your newspaper confederates took 
the peace out of my hands. The peace did not find me 
out because it did not find me in. 

FRANKLYN. Come! Confess, both of you. You 
were only flies on the wheel. The war went England’s 
way ; but the peace went its own way, and not England’s 
way nor any of the ways you had so glibly appointed 
for it. Your peace treaty was a scrap of paper before 
the ink dried on it. The statesmen of Europe were in- 
capable of governing Europe. What they needed was a 
couple of hundred years training and experience: what 
they actually had was a few years at the bar or in a 
counting-house or on the grouse moors and golf courses. 
And now we are waiting, with monster cannons trained 
on every city and seaport, and huge aeroplanes ready 
to spring into the air and drop bombs every one of 
which will obliterate a whole street, and poison gases 
that will strike multitudes dead with a breath, until one 
of you gentlemen rises in his helplessness to tell us, who 
are as helpless as himself, that we are al war again. | 

conrap. Aha! What consolation will it be for us — 


82 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


then that you two are able to tell off one another’s 
defects so cleverly in your afternoon chat? 

BuRGE [angrily] If you come to that, what consola- 
tion will it be that you two can sit there and tell both of 
us off? you, who have had no responsibility! you, who 
havnt lifted a finger, as far as I know, to help us 
through this awful crisis which has left me ten years 
older than my proper age! Can you tell me a single 
thing you did to help us during the whole infernal 
business? 

conrap. We're not blaming you: you hadnt lived 
long enough. No more had we. Cant you see that 
three-score-and-ten, though it may be long enough for 
a very crude sort of village life, isnt long enough for a 
complicated civilization like ours? Flinders Petrie has 
counted nine attempts at civilization made by people 
exactly like us; and everyone of them failed just as ours 
is failing. They failed because the citizens and states- 
men died of old age or overeating before they had 
grown out of schoolboy games and savage sports and 
cigars and champagne. The signs of the end are 
‘always the same: Democracy, Socialism, and Votes for 
Women. We shall go to smash within the lifetime of 
‘men now living unless we recognize that we must live 
igwert 

LUBIN. I am glad you agree with me that Socialism 
and Votes for Women are signs of decay. 

FRANKLYN. Not at all: they are only the difficulties 
that overtax your capacity. If you cannot organize 
Socialism you cannot organize civilized life; and you 
will relapse into barbarism accordingly. 

savvy. Hear, hear! 

ae A useful point. We cannot put back the 
clock. 


HASLAM. J can. Ive often done it. 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 83 


, usin. Tut tut! My dear Burge: what are you 
dreaming of? Mr. Barnabas: I am a very patient man. 
But will you tell me what earthly use or interest there 
is in a conclusion that cannot be realized? I grant you 
that if we could live three hundred years we should all 
be, perhaps wiser, certainly older. You will grant me 
in return, I hope, that if the sky fell we should all catch 
larks. 

FRANKLYN. Your turn now, Conrad. Go ahead. 

conrap. I dont think it’s any good. I dont think 
they want to live longer than usual. 

LuBIN. Although I am a mere child of 69, I am old 
enough to have lost the habit of crying for the moon. 

BURGE. Have you discovered the elixir of life or have 
you not? If not, I agree with Lubin that you are wast- 
ing our time. 

conkap. Is your time of any value? 

BURGE [unable to believe his ears] My time of any 
value! What do you mean? 

LuBIN | smiling comfortably] From your high scien- 
tific point of view, I daresay, none whatever, Professor. | 
In any case I think a little perfectly idle discussion 
would do Burge good. After all, we might as well hear 
about the elixir of life as read novels, or whatever Burge 
does when he is not playing golf on Walton Heath. 
What is your elixir, Dr Barnabas? Lemons? Sour 
milk? Or what is the latest? 

BURGE. We were just beginning to talk seriously; 
and now you snatch at the chance of talking rot. [He 
rises}. Good evening. [He turns to the door]. 

conrapD [rudely] Die as soon as you like. Good even- 
ing. 

ees [hesitating] Look here. I took sour milk twice 
a day until Metchnikoff died. He thought it would keep 
him alive “or ever; and he died of it. 


84 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


conrzap. You might as well have taken sour beer. 

BURGE. You believe in lemons? 

conraD. J wouldnt eat a lemon for ten pounds. 

BURGE [sitting down again] What do you recom- 
mend? 

conrap [rising with a gesture of despair] Whats the 
use of going on, Frank? Because I am a doctor, and 
because they think I have a bottle to give them that will 
make them live for ever, they are listening to me for the 
first time with their mouths open and their eyes shut. 
Thats their notion of science. 

savvy. Steady, Nunk! Hold the fort. 

conrzaD [| growls and sits down| |! } 

LuBIN. You volunteered the consultation, Doctor. I 
may tell you that, far from sharing the credulity as to 
science which is now the fashion, I am prepared to dem- 
onstrate that during the last fifty years, though the 
Church has often been wrong, and even the Liberal Party 
has not been infallible, the men of science have always 
been wrong. 

conraD. Yes: the fellows you call men of science. 
The people who make money by it, and their medical 
hangers-on. But has anybody been right? 

tuBiN. The poets and story tellers, especially the 
classical poets and story tellers, have been, in the main, 
right. I will ask you not to repeat this as my opinion 
outside; for the vote of the medical profession and its 
worshippers is not to be trifled with. 

FRANKLYN. You are quite right: the poem is our real 
clue to biological science. The most scientific document 
we possess at present is, as your grandmother would 
nee told you quite truly, the story of the Garden of 

en. 

BuRCE | pricking up his ears] Whats that? If you 
can establish that, Barnabas, I am prepared to hear you 


Part II Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 85 


out with my very best attention. I am listening, 
Go on. 

FRANKLYN. Well, you remember, dont you, that in 
the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve were not created 
mortal, and that natural death, as we call it, was not a 
part of life, but a later and quite separate invention? 

BuRGE. Now you mention it, thats true. Death came 
afterwards. 

LUBIN. What about accidental death? That was 
always possible. 

FRANKLYN. Precisely. Adam and Eve were hung up 
between two frightful possibilities. One was the extinc- 
tion of mankind by their accidental death. The other 
was the prospect of living for ever. They could bear 
neither. They decided that they would just take a short 
turn of a thousand years, and meanwhile hand on their 
work to a new pair. Consequently, they had to invent 
natural birth and natural death, which are, after all, 
only modes of perpetuating life without putting on any 
single creature the terrible burden of immortality. 

LUBIN. I see. The old must make room for the new. 

purcE. Death is nothing but making room. Thats 
all there is in it or ever has been in it. 

FRANKLYN. Yes; but the old must not desert their 
posts until the new are ripe for them. They desert them 
now two hundred years too soon. 

savvy. I believe the old people are the new people re- 
incarnated, Nunk. I suspect Iam Eve. I am very fond 
of apples; and they always disagree with me. 

CONRAD. You are Eve, in a sense. The Eternal Life 
persists ; only It wears out Its bodies and minds and gets 
new ones, like new clothes. You are only a new hat and 
frock on Eve. 

FRANKLYN. Yes. Bodies and minds ever better and 
better fitted to carry out Its eterna] pursuit. 


86 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part IT 


LUBIN [with quiet scepticism] What pursuit, may one 
ask, Mr Barnabas? 

——¥YRANKLYN. The pursuit of omnipotence and om- 
niscience. Greater power and greater knowledge: these 
are what we are all pursuing even at the risk of our lives 
and the sacrifice of our pleasures. Evolution is that 
pursuit and nothing else. It is the path of godhead. 
A man differs from a microbe only in being further on 
the path. 

 Luzin. And how soon do you expect this modest end 
to be reached? 

i FRANKLYN, Never, thank God! ‘As there is no limit 
to power and knowledge there can be no end. ‘The 
power and the glory, world without end”: have those 
words meant nothing to you? 

BURGE [pulling out an old envelope] I should like to 
make a note of that. [He does so]. 

conrap. There will always be something to live for. 

BURGE | pocketing his envelope and becoming more and 
more business like| Right: I have got that. Now what 
about sin? What about the Fall? How do you work 
them in? 

conrap. I dont work in the Fall. The Fall is out- 
side Science. But I daresay Frank can work it in for 
you. 

BuRGE [to Franklyn] I wish you would, you know. 
It’s important.- Very important. 

FRANKLYN. Well, consider it this way. It is clear 
that when Adam and Eve were immortal it was neces- 
sary that they should make the earth an extremely com- 
fortable place to live in. 

purcE. True. If you take a house on a ninety-nine 
years lease, you spend a good deal of money on it. If 
you take it for three months you generally have a bill 
for dilapidations to pay at the end of them. 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 87 


FRANKLYN. Just so. Consequently, when Adam had 
the Garden of Eden on a lease for ever, he took care to’ 
make it what the house agents call a highly desirable 
country residence. But the moment he invented death, 
and became a tenant for life only, the place was no 
longer worth the trouble. It was then that he let the 
thistles grow. Life was so short that it was no longer 
worth his while to do anything thoroughly well, 

BURGE. Do you think that is enough to constitute 
what an average elector would consider a Fall? Is it 
tragic enough? 

FRANKLYN. That is only the first step of the Fall. 
Adam did not fall down that step only: he fell down a 
whole flight. For instance, before he invented birth he 
dared not have lost his temper; for if he had killed Eve 
he would have been lonely and barren to all eternity. 
But when he invented birth, and anyone who was killed 
could be replaced, he could afford to let himself go. He 
undoubtedly invented wife-beating; and that was an- 
other step down. One of his sons invented meat-eating. 
The other was horrified at the innovation. With the 
ferocity which is still characteristic of bulls and other 
vegetarians, he slew his beefsteak-eating brother, and 
thus invented murder. That was a very steep step. It 
was so exciting that all the others began to kill one an- 
other for sport, and thus invented war, the steepest step 
of all. They even took to killing animals as a means 
of killing time, and then, of course, ate them to save the 
long and difficult labor of agriculture. I ask you to 
contemplate our fathers as they came crashing down all 
the steps of this Jacob’s ladder that reached from para- 
dise to a hell on earth in which they had multiplied the 
chances of death from violence, accident, and disease 
until they could hardly count on three score and ten 
years of life, much less the thousand that Adam had 


88 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part It 


been ready to face! With that picture before you, will 
you now ask me where was the Fall? You might as well 
stand at the foot of Snowden and ask me where is the 
mountain. The very children see it so plainly that they 
compress its history into a two line epic: 


Old Daddy Long Legs wouldnt say his prayers: 
Take him by the hind legs and throw him downstairs. 


LUBIN [still immovably sceptical] And what does 
Science say to this fairy tale, Doctor Barnabas? Surely 
Science knows nothing of Genesis, or of Adam and Eve. 

conraD. Then it isnt Science: thats all. Science has 
to account for everything; and everything includes the 
Bible. 

FRANKLYN. The Book of Genesis is a part of nature 
like any other part of nature. The fact that the tale of 
the Garden of Eden has survived and held the imagina- 
tion of men spellbound for centuries, whilst hundreds 
of much more plausible and amusing stories have gone 
out of fashion and perished like last year’s popular 
song, 1s a scientific fact; and Science is bound to explain 
it. You tell me that Science knows nothing of it. Then 
Science is more ignorant than the children at any village 
school. 

conrap. Of course if you think it more scientific to 
say that what we are discussing is not Adam and Eve 
and Eden, but the phylogeny of the blastoderm— 

savvy. You neednt swear, Nunk. 

conrad. Shut up, you: I am not swearing. [To 
Lubin]. If you want the professional humbug of re- 
writing the Bible in words of four syllables, and pre- 
tending it’s something new, I can humbug you to your 
heart’s content. I can call Genesis Phylogenesis. Let 
the Creator say, if you like, “I will establish an anti- 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 89 


pathetic symbiosis between thee and the female, and be- 
tween thy blastoderm and her blastoderm.” Nobody 
will understand you; and Savvy will think you are swear- 
ing. The meaning is the same. 

HASLAM. Priceless. But it’s quite simple. The one 
version 1s poetry: the other is science. 

FRANKLYN. The one is classroom jargon: the other is 
inspired human language. 

LUBIN [calmly reminiscent] One of the few modern 
authors into whom I have occasionally glanced is Rous- 
seau, who was a sort of Deist like Burge— 

BURGE [interrupting him forcibly] Lubin: has this 
stupendously important communication which Professor 
Barnabas has just made to us: a communication for 
which I shall be indebted to him all my life long: has 
this, I say, no deeper effect on you than to set you 
pulling my leg by trying to make out that I am an 
infidel ? 

LuBIN. It’s very interesting and amusing, Burge; 
and I think I see a case init. I think I could undertake 
to argue it in an ecclesiastical court. But important is 
hardly a word I should attach to it. 

BurcE. Good God! Here is this professor: a man 
utterly removed from the turmoil of our political life: 
devoted to pure learning in its most abstract phases; 
and I solemnly declare he is the greatest politician, the 
most inspired party Icader, in the kingdom. I take off 
my hat to him. I, Joyce Burge, give him best. And 
you sit there purring like an Angora cat, and can see 
nothing in it! 

conrap [opening his eyes widely] Hallo! What have 
I done to deserve this tribute? 

nurcE. Done! You have put the Liberal Party 
into power for the next thirty years, Doctor: thats what 
youve done. 


90 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


conRaAD. God forbid! | 

BuRGE. It’s all up with the Church now. Thanks to 
you, we go to the country with one cry and one only: 
Back to the Bible! Think of the effect on the Noncon- 
formist vote. You gather that in with one hand; and 
you gather in the modern scientific sceptical profes- 
sional vote with the other. The village atheist and the 
first cornet in the local Salvation Army band meet on 
the village green and shake hands. You take your 
school children, your Bible class under the Cowper-Tem- 
ple clause, into the museum. You shew the kids the Pilt- 
down skull; and you say, “Thats Adam. Thats Eve’s 
husband.” You take the spectacled science student from 
the laboratory in Owens College; and when he asks you 
for a truly scientific history of Evolution, you put into 
his hand The Pilgrim’s Progress. You—[Savvy and 
Haslam explode into shrieks of merriment]. What are 
you two laughing at? 

savvy. Oh, go on, Mr Burge. Dont stop. 

conraD. Priceless! 7 

FRANKLYN. Would thirty years of office for the Lib- 
eral Party seem so important to you, Mr Burge, if you 
had another two and a half centuries to live? 

BURGE [decisively] No. You will have to drop that 
part of it. The constituencies wont swallow it. 

LuBIN [seriously] I am not so sure of that, Burge. I 
am not sure that'it may not prove the only point they 
will swallow. 

BuRcE. It will be no use to us even if they do. Ii’s 
not a party point. It’s as good for the other side as 
for us. 

LuBIN. Not necessarily. If we get in first with it, 
it will be associated in the public mind with our party. 
Suppose I put it forward as a plank in our program 
that we advocate the extension of human life to three 


PartII Gospel! of the Brothers Barnabas 91 


hundred years! Dunreen, as leader of the opposite 
party, will be bound to oppose me: to denounce me as a 
visionary and so forth. By doing so he will place him- 
self in the positiow of wanting to rob the people of two 
hundred and chirty years of their natural life. The 
Unionists will become the party of Premature Death; 
and we shall become the Longevity party. 

BURGE [shaken] You really think the electorate would 
swallow it? ie 

LuBIN. My dear Burge: is there anything the elec- 
torate will not swallow if it is judiciously put to them? 
But we must make sure of our ground. We must have 
the support of the men of science. Is there serious 
agreement among them, Doctor, as to the possibility of 
such an evolution as you have described? 

conraDp. Yes. Ever since the reaction against Dar- 
win set in at the beginning of the present century, all 
scientific opinion worth counting has been converging 
rapidly upon Creative Evolution. 

FRANKLYN. Poetry has been converging on it: phil- 
osophy has been converging on it: religion has been con- 
verging on it. It is going to be the religion of the twen- 
tieth century: a religion that has its intellectual roots in 
philosophy and science just as medieval Christianity 
had its intellectual roots in Aristotle. 

Lupin. But surely any change would be so extremely 
gradual that— 

conrap. Dont deceive yourself. It’s only the politi- 
cians who improve the world so gradually that nobody 
can see the improvement. The notion that Nature does 
not proceed by jumps is only one of the budget of 
plausible lies that we call classical education. Nature 
always proceeds by jumps. She may spend twenty thou- 
sand years making up her mind to jump; but when she 


92 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


makes it up at last, the jump is big enough to take us 
into a new age. 

LuBIN [impressed] Fancy my being leader of the 
party for the next three hundred years! 

puRGE. What! !! 

LuBIN. Perhaps hard on some of the younger men. I 
think in fairness I shall have to step aside to make room 
after another century or so: that is, if Mimi can be per- 
suaded to give up Downing Street. 

BURGE. ‘This is too much. Your collossal conceit 
blinds you to the most obvious necessity of the political 
situation. 

LuBIN. You mean my retirement. I really cannot see 
that it is a necessity. I could not see it when I was al- 
most an old man—or at least an elderly one. Now that 
it ‘appears that I am a young man, the case for it breaks 
down completely. [T'o Conrad]. May I ask are there 
any alternative theories? Is there a scientific Opposi- 
tion ? 

conrap. Well, some authorities hold that the human 
race is a failure, and that a new form of life, better 
adapted to high civilization, will supersede us as we have 
superseded the ape and the elephant. 

BuRGE. ‘The superman: eh? 

conrad. No. Some being quite different from us. 

LuBIN. Is that altogether desirable? 

FRANKLYN. I fear so. However that may be, we may 
be quite sure of one thing. We shall not be let alone. 

The force behind evolution, call it what you will, is de- 
termined to solve the problem of civilization; and if it 
cannot do it through us, it will produce some more 
capable agents. Man is not God’s last word: God can 
still create. If you cannot do His work He will produce 
some being who can. 

—- BURGE [with zealous reverence| What do we know 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 93 


about Him, Barnabas? What does anyone know about 
Him? 

conrap. We know this about Him with absolute cer- 
tainty. The power my brother calls God proceeds by the 
method of Trial and Error; and if we turn out to be one 
of the errors, we shall go the way of the mastodon and 
the megatherium and all the other scrapped experi- 
ments. 

LUBIN [rising and beginning to walk up and down the 
room with his considering cap on] I admit that I am im- 
pressed, gentlemen. I will go so far as to say that your 
theory is likely to prove more interesting than ever 
Welsh Disestablishment was. But as a practical politi- 
cian—hm! Eh, Burge? 

conrap. We are not practical politicians. We are 
out to get something done. Practical politicians are 
people who have mastered the art of using parliament to 
prevent anything being done. 

FRANKLYN. When we get matured statesmen and citi- 
zens— 

LuBin [stopping short] Citizens! Oh! Are the citi- 
zens to live three hundred years as well as the states- 
men? 

coxraD. Of course. 

tug. I confess that had not occurred to me. [He 
sits down abruptly, evidently very unfavorably affected 
by this new light |. 

Savvy and Haslam look at one another with unspeak- 
able feelings. 

puRGE. Do you think it would be wise to go quite: so 
far at first? Surely it would be more prudent to begin 
with the best men. 

yRANKLYN. You need not be anxious about that. It 


will begin with the best men. 


94 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


LUBIN. I am glad to hear you say so. You see, we 
must put this into a practical parliamentary shape. 

BpurcE. We shall have to draft a Bill: that is the 
long and the short of it. Until you have your Bill 
drafted you dont know what you are really doing: that 
is my experience. | ; 

LUBIN. Quite so. My idea is that whilst we should 
interest the electorate in this as a sort of religious asp1- 
ration and personal hope, using it at the same time to 
remove their prejudices against those of us who are 
getting on in years, it would be in the last degree up- 
setting and even dangerous to enable everyone to live 
longer than usual. Take the mere question of the manu- 
facture of the specific, whatever it may be! There are 
forty millions of people in the country. Let me assume 
for the sake of illustration that each person would have 
to consume, say, five ounces a day of the elixir. That 
would be—let me see—five times three hundred and 
sixty-five is—um—twenty-five—thirty-two—eighteen— 
eighteen hundred and twenty-five ounces a year: just 
two ounces over the hundredweight. 

BuRGE. Two million tons a year, in round numbers, 
of stuff that everyone would clamor for: that men would 
trample down women and children in the streets to 
get at. You couldnt produce it. There would be blue 
murder. It’s out of the question. We must keep the 
actual secret to ourselves. 

conraD [staring at them] The actual secret! What 
on earth is the man talking about? 

BuRGE. ‘The stuff. The powder. The bottle. The 
tabloid. Whatever it is. You said it wasnt lemons. 

conrad. My good sir: I have no powder, no bottle, 
no tabloid. I am not a quack: I am a biologist. This 
is a thing thats going to happen. 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 95 


LUBIN [completely let down] Going to happen! Oh! 
Is that all? [He looks at his watch]. 

BURGE. Going to happen! What do you mean? Do 
you mean that you cant make it happen? 

conrad. No more than I could have made you 
happen? 

FRANKLYN. We can put it into men’s heads that there 
is nothing to prevent its happening but their own will to 
die before their work is done, and their own ignorance of 
the splendid work there is for them to do. 

conrap. Spread that knowledge and that convic- 
tion; and as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow, the 
thing will happen. 

FRANKLYN. We dont know where or when or to whom 
it will happen. It may happen first to someone in this 
room. 

HASLAM. It would happen to me: thats jolly sure. 

conraD. It might happen to anyone. It might hap- 
pen to the parlormaid. How do we know? 

savvy. The parlormaid! Oh, thats nonsense, Nunk. 

LuBIN [once more quite comfortable] I think Miss 
Savvy has delivered the final verdict. 

BuRGE. Do you mean to say that you have nothing 
more practical to offer than the mere wish to hive longer? 
Why, if people could live by merely wishing to, we 
should all be living for ever already! Everybody would 
like to live for ever. Why dont they? 

conraD. Pshaw! Everybody would like to have a 
million of money. Why havnt they? Because the men 
who would like to be millionaires wont save sixpence even 
with the chance of starvation staring them in the face. 
The men who want to live for ever wont cut off a glass 
of beer or a pipe of tobacco, though they believe the 
teetotallers and non-smokers live longer. That sort of 


96 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


liking is not willing. See what they do when they know 
they must. 

FRANKLYN. Do not mistake mere idle fancies for the 
tremendous miracle-working force of Will nerved to 
creation by a conviction of Necessity. I tell you men 
gapable of such willing, and realizing its necessity, will 
do it reluctantly, under inner compulsion, as all great 
efforts are made. They will hide what they are doing 
from themselves: they will take care not to know what 
they are doing. They will live three hundred years, not 
because they would like to, but because the soul deep 
down in them will know that they must, if the world is 
to be saved. 

LuBIN [turning to Franklyn and patting him almost 
paternally | Well, my dear Barnabas, for the last thirty 
years the post has brought me at least once a week a 
plan from some crank or other for the establishment of 
the millennium. I think you are the maddest of all the 
cranks; but you are much the most interesting. I am 
conscious of a very curious mixture of relief and disap- 
pointment in finding that your plan is all moonshine, and 
that you have nothing practical to offer us. But what 
a pity! Itis such a fascinating idea! I think you are 
too hard on us practical men; but there are men in every 
Government, even on the Front Bench, who deserve all 
you say. And now, before dropping the subject, may I 
put just one question to you? An idle question, since 
nothing can come of it; but still— 

FRANKLYN. Ask vour question. 

LuBin. Why do you fix three hundred years as the 
exact figure? 

FRANKLYN. Because we must fix some figure. Less 
would not be enough; and more would be more than we 
dare as yet face. 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 97 


LuBIN. Pooh! I am quite prepared to face three 
thousand not to say three million. 

CONRAD. Yes. because you dont believe you will be 
called on to make good your word. 

FRANKLYN | gently] Also, perhaps, because you have 
never been troubled much by visions of the future. 

BURGE | with intense conviction] The future does not 
exist for Henry Hopkins Lubin. 

LuBin. If by the future you mean the millenial delu- 
sions which you use as a bunch of carrots to lure the 
uneducated British donkey to the polling booth to vote 
for you, it certainly does not. 

BuRGE. I can see the future not only because, if I 
may say so in all humility, I have been gifted with a cer- 
tain power of spiritual vision, but because I have prac- 
tised as a solicitor. A solicitor has to advise families. 
He has to think of the future and know the past. His 
office is the real modern confessional. Among other 
things he has to make people’s wills for them. He has 
to shew them how to provide for their daughters after 
their deaths. Has it occurred to you, Lubin, that if 
you live three hundred years, your daughters will have 
to wait a devilish long time for their money? 

FRANKLYN. The money may not wait for them. Few 
investments flourish for three hundred years. 

savvy. And what about before your death? Sup- 
pose they didn’t get married! Imagine a girl living at 
home with her mother and on her father for three hun- 
dred years! Theyd murder her if she didnt murder 
them first. | 

tusin. By the way, Barnabas, is your daughter to 
keep her good looks all the time? 

FRANKLYN. Will it matter? Can you conceive the 
most hardened flirt going on flirting for three centu- 


98 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


ries? At the end of half the time we shall hardly notice 
whether it is a woman or a man we are speaking to. 

LuBin [not quite relishing this ascetic prospect] Hm! 
[He rises]. Ah, well: you must come and tell my wife 
and my young people all about it; and you will bring 
your daughter with you, of course. [He shakes hands 
with Savvy]. Good-bye. [He shakes hands with 
Franklyn]. Good-bye, Doctor. [He shakes hands with 
Conrad]. Come on Burge; you must really tell me 
what line you are going to take about the Church at the 
election? , 

BuRGE. Havnt you heard? Havnt you taken in the 
revelation that has been vouchsafed to us? The line I 
am going to take is Back to Methuselah. 

LuBin [decisively] Dont be ridiculous, Burge. You 
dont suppose, do you, that our friends here are in 
earnest, or that our very pleasant conversation has had 
anything to do with practical politics! They have just 
been pulling our legs very wittily. Come along. [He 
goes out, Franklyn politely going with him, but shak- 
ing his head in mute protest]. 

BURGE [shaking Conrad’s hand] It’s beyond the old 
man, Doctor. No spiritual side to him: only a sort of 
classical side that goes down with his own set. Besides, 
he’s done, gone, past, burnt out, burst up; thinks he is 
our leader and is only our rag and bottle department. 
But you may depend on me. I will work this stunt of 
yours in. I see its value. [He begins moving towards 
the door with Conrad]. Of course I cant put it exactly 
in your way; but you are quite right about our needing 
something fresh; and I believe an election can be fought 
on the death rate and on Adam and Eve as scientific 
facts. It will take the Opposition right out of its depth. 
And if we win there will be an O.M. for somebody when 
tne first honors list comes round. [By this time he has 


PartII Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas 99 


talked himself out of the room and out of earshot, Con- 
rad accompanying him]. 

Savvy and Haslam, left alone, seize each other in an 
ecstasy of amusement, and jazz to the settee, where they 
sit down again side by side. 

HasLaM [caressing her] Darling! What a priceless 
humbug old Lubin is! 

savvy. Oh, sweet old thing! Ilove him. Burge is a 
flaming fraud if you like. 

HASLAM. Did you notice one thing? It struck me as 
rather curious. 

savvy. What? 

HasLAM. Lubin and your father have both survived 
the war. But their sons were killed in it. 

savvy [sobered|] Yes. Jim’s death killed mother. 

HASLAM. And they never said a word about it! 

savvy. Well, why should they? The subject didnt 
come up. I forgot about it too; and I was very fond 
of Jim. 

HASLAM. [I didnt forget it, because I’m of military 
age; and 1f I hadnt been a parson I’d have had to go 
out anc *- killed too. To me the awful thing about their 
political incompetence was that they had to kill their 
own sons. It was the war casualty lists and the starva- 
tion afterwards that finished me up with politics and the 
Church and everything else except you. 

savvy. Oh, I was just as bad as any of them. I sold 
flags in the streets in my best clothes; and—hsh! [She 
jumps up and pretends to be looking for a book on the 
shelves behind the settee]. 

Franklyn and Conrad return, looking weary and glum. 

conrap. Well, thats how the gospel of the brothers 
Barnabas is going to be received! [He drops into 


Burge’s chair]. 


100 Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas Part II 


FRANKLYN [going back to his seat at the table] It’s 
no use. Were you convinced, Mr Haslam? 

HasLAM. About our being able to live three hundred 
years? Frankly, no. 

conrap [to Savvy | Nor you, I suppose? 

savvy. Oh, I dont know. I thought I was for a 
moment. I can believe, in a sort of way, that people 
might live for three hundred years. But when you came 
down to tin tacks, and said that the parlormaid might, 
then I saw how absurd it was. 

FRANKLYN. Justso. We had better hold our tongues 
about it, Con. We should only be laughed at, and 
lose the little credit we earned on false pretences in the 
days of our ignorance. 

conraD. I daresay. But Creative Evolution doesnt 
stop while people are laughing. Laughing may even 
lubricate its job. 

savvy. What does that mean? 

conraD. It means that the first man to live three 
hundred years maynt have the slightest notion that he is 
going to do it, and may be the loudest laugher of the 
lot. 

savvy. Or the first woman? 

conRaD [assenting| Or the first woman. 

HASLAM. Well, it wont be one of us, anyhow. 

FRANKLYN. How do you know? 

This 1s unanswerable. None of them have anything 
more to say. 


PART Il 
THE THING HAPPENS 
XXXIV 


THE THING HAPPENS 


A summer afternoon in the year 2170 a.v. The offi 
cial parlor of the President of the British Islands. A 
board table, long enough for three chairs at each side 
besides the presidential chair at the head and an ordinary 
chatr at the foot, occupies the breadth of the room. On 
the table, opposite every chair, a small switchboard with 
a dial. There is no fireplace. The end wall is a silvery 
screen nearly as large as a pair of folding doors. The 
door is on your left as you face the screens and there is 
a row of thick pegs, padded and covered with velvet, 
beside it. 

A stoutish middle-aged man, good-looking and breez- 
ily general, dressed im a silk smock, stockings, hand- 
somely ornamented sandals, and a gold fillet round his 
brows, comes m. He 4s like Joyce Burge, yet also like 
Lubin, as if Nature had made a composite photograph 
of the two men. He takes off the fillet and hangs it on 
a peg; then sits down m the presidential chair at the 
head of the table, which is at the end farthest from the 
door. He puts a peg into his switchboard; turns the 
pointer on the dial; puts another peg in; and presses a 
button. Immediately the silvery screen vanishes; and 
in its place appears, im reverse from right to left, an- 
other office similarly furnished, with a thin, wnamiable 
man similarly dressed, but in duller colors, turning over 
some documents at the table. His gold fillet is hanging 

103 


104 The Thing Happens Part III 


up on a similar peg beside the door. He is rather like 
Conrad Barnabas, but younger, and much more common- 


place. 


BURGE-LUBIN. Hallo, Barnabas! 

paRnasas [without looking round] What number? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Five double x three two games. Burge- 
Lubin. 

Barnabas puts a plug in number five; turns hts 
pointer to double x; puts another plug m 32; presses a 
button and looks round at Burge-Lubin, who is now 
visible to him as well as audible. 

parnaBas [curtly] Oh! That you, President? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Yes. ‘They told me you wanted me 
to ring you up. Anything wrong? 

BARNABAS [harsh and querulous] I wish to make a 
‘protest. 

BURGE-LUBIN [good-humored and mocking] What! 
‘Another protest! Whats wrong now? 

BARNABAS. If you only knew all the protests I 
havent made, you would be surprised at my patience. 
It is you who are always treating me with the grossest 
want of consideration. 

BURGE-LUBIN. What have I done now? 

BARNABAS. You have put me down to go to the 
Record Office to-day to receive that American fellow, and 
do the honors of a ridiculous cinema show. That is not 
the business of the Accountant General: it is the busi- 
ness of the President. It is an outrageous waste of my 
time, and an unjustifiable shirking of your duty at my 
expense. I refuse to go. You must go. 

BURGE-LUBIN. My dear boy, nothing would give me 
greater pleasure than to take the job off your hands— 

BARNABAS. Then do it. Thats all I want [he is 
about to switch off |. 


Part III The Thing Happens 105 


BURGE-LUBIN. Dont switch off. Listen. This 
American has invented a method of breathing under 
water. 

BARNABAS. Whatdol care? I dont want to breathe 
under water. 

BURGE-LUBIN. You may, my dear Barnabas, at any 
time. You know you never look where you are going 
when you are immersed in your calculations. Some day 
you will walk into the Serpentine. ‘This man’s invention 
may save your life. 

BARNABAS { angrily] Will you tell me what that has to 
do with your putting your ceremonial duties on to my 
shoulders? I will not be trifled [he vanishes and its re- 
placed by the blank screen|— 

BURGE-LUBIN [indignantly holding down his button] 
Dont cut us off, please: we have not finished. I am the 
President, speaking to the Accountant General. What 
are you dreaming of? 

A woman’ voice. Sorry. [The screen shows Bar- 
nabas as before}. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Since you take it that way, I will go 
in your place. It’s a pity, because, you see, this Ameri- 
can thinks you are the greatest living authority on the 
duration of human life; and— 

BARNABAS [interrupting] The ‘American thinks! 
What do you mean? I am the greatest living authority 
on the duration of human life. Who dares dispute it? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Nobody, dear lad, nobody. Dont fly 
out at me. It is evident that you have not read the 
American’s book. 

BARNABAS. Dont tell me that you have, or that you 
have read any book except a novel for the last twenty 
years; for I wont believe you. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Quite right, dear old fellow: I havnt 


106 The Thing Happens Part III 


read it. But I have read what The Times Literary Sup- 
plement says about it. 

BARNABAS. I dont care two straws what it says about 
it. Does it say anything about me? ~ 

BURGE-LUBIN. Yes. 

BARNABAS. Oh! does it? What? 

BURGE-LUBIN. It points out that an extraordinary 
number of first-rate persons like you and me have died 
by drowning during the last two centuries, and that 
when this invention of breathing under water takes 
effect, your estimate of the average duration of human

BARNABAS [alarmed| Upset my estimate! Gracious 
Heavens! Does the fool realize what that means? Do 
you realize what that means? 

BURGE-LUBIN. I suppose it means that we shall have 
to amend the Act. 

BARNABAS. Amend my Act! Monstrous! 

BURGE-LUBIN. But we must. We cant ask people to 
go on working until they are forty-three unless our 
figures are unchallengable. You know what a row there 
was over those last three years, and how nearly the too- 
old-at-forty people won. 

BARNABAS. ‘They would have made the British 
Islands bankrupt if theyd won. But you dont care for 
that: you care for nothing but being popular. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Qh, well: I shouldnt worry if I were 
you; for most people complain that there is not enough 
work for them, and would be only too glad to stick on 
instead of retiring at forty-three, if only they were 
asked as a favor instead of having to. 

BARNABAS. ‘Thank you: I need no consolation. [He 
rises determinedly and puts on his fillet].

Part III The Thing Happens 107, 


BARNABAS. T'o that cinema tomfoolery, of course. I 
re put this American imposter in his place. [He goes 
out |. 

BURGE-LUBIN [calling after him] God bless you, dear 
old chap! [With a chuckle, he switches off; and the 
screen becomes blank. He presses a button and holds it 
down while he cails| Hallo! 

A WOMAN’s voice. Hallo! 

BURGE-LUBIN [formally| The President respectfully 
solicits the privilege of an interview with the Chief 
Secretary, and holds himself entirely at his honor’s 
august disposal. 

A CHINESE VOICE. He is coming. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Qh! That you, Confucius? So good 
of you. Come along [he releases the button}. 

A man in a yellow gown, presenting the general ap- 
pearance of a Chimese sage, enters. 

BURGE-LUBIN [jocularly] Well, illustrious Sage-&- 
Onions, how are your poor sore feet? 

conrucius [gravely] I thank you for your kind 
enauiries. I am well. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Thats right. Sit down and make 
yourself comfortable. Any business for me today? 

conFucius [sitting down on the first chair round the 
corner of the table to the President’s right | None. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Have you heard the result of the bye- 
election? 

conrucius. A walk-over. Only one candidate. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Any good? 

conrucius. He was released from the County 
Lunatic Asylum a fortnight ago. Not mad enough for 
the lethal chamber: not sane enough for any place but 
the division lobby. A very popular speaker. 

RURGE-LUBIN. I wish the people would take a serious 


interest in politics. 


108 The Thing Happens Part III 


conrucius. I do not agree. The Englishman is not 
fitted by nature to understand politics. Ever since the 
public services have been manned by Chinese, the country 
has been well and honestly governed. What more 1s 
needed? 

BURGE-LUBIN. What I cant make out is that China 
is one of the worst governed countries on earth. 

conrucius. No. It was badly governed twenty 
years ago; but since we forbade any Chinaman to take 
part in our public services, and imported natives of 
Scotland for that purpose, we have done well. Your 
information here is always twenty years out of date. 

BURGE-LUBIN. People dont seem to be able to govern 
themselves. I cant understand it. Why should it be so? 

conFucivus. Justice is impartiality. Only strangers 
are impartial. 

BURGE-LUBIN. It ends in the public services being so 
good that the Government has nothing to do but think. 

conrucius. Were it otherwise, the Government 
would have too much to do to think. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Is that any excuse for the English 
people electing a parliament of lunatics? 

conrucius. The English people always did elect 
parliaments of lunatics. What does it matter if your 
permanent officials are honest and competent? 

BURGE-LUBIN. You do not know the history of this 
country. What would my ancestors have said to the 
menagerie of degenerates that is still called the House 
of Commons? Confucius: you will not believe me; and 
I do not blame you for it; but England once saved the 
liberties of the world by inventing parliamentary gov- 
ernment, which was her peculiar and supreme glory. 

conFucius. I know the history of your country per- 
fectly well. It proves the exact contrary. 

BURGE-LUBIN. How do you make that out? 


Part III The Thing Happens 109 


cunFucius. ‘The only power your parliament ever 

ee was the power of withholding supplies from the 
ing. . 

BURGE-LUBIN. Precisely. ‘That great Englishman 
Simon de Montfort— 

conFucius. He was not an Englishman: he was a 
Frenchman. He imported parliaments from France. 

BURGE-LUBIN [surprised | You dont say so! 

conFrucius. ‘The king and his loyal subjects killed 
Simon for forcing his French parliament on them. The 
first thing British parliaments always did was to grant 
supplies to the king for life with enthusiastic expressions 
of loyalty, lest they should have any real power, and be 
expected to do something. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Look here, Confucius: you know more 
history than I do, of course; but democracy— 

conFucius. An institution peculiar to China. And 
it was never really a success there. 

BURGE-LUBIN. But the Habeas Corpus Act! 

conrucius. ‘The English always suspended it when 
it threatened to be of the slightest use. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Well, trial by jury: you cant deny 
that we established that? 

conFucius. All cases that were dangerous to the 
governing classes were tried in the Star Chamber or by 
Court Martial, except when the prisoner was not tried 
at all, but executed after calling him names enough to 
make him unpopular. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Oh, bother! You may be right in 
these little details; but in the large we have managed to 
hold our own as a great race. Well, people who could 
do nothing couldnt have done that, you know. 

conructus. I did not say you could do nothing. 
You could fight. You could eat. You could drink. 
Until the twentieth century you could produce children. 


110 The Thing Happens Part III 


You could play games. You could work when you were 
forced to. But you could not govern yourselves. _ 

BURGE-LUBIN. ‘Then how did we get our reputation 
as the pioneers of liberty? 

cunrucius. By your steadfast refusal to be gov- 
erned at all. A horse that kicks everyone who tries to 
harness and guide him may be a pioneer of liberty; but 
he is not a pioneer of government. In China he would 
be shot. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Stuff! Do you imply that the ad- 
ministration of which I am president is no Government? 

conrucius. Ido. JI am the Government. 

BURGE-LUBIN. You! You!! You fat yellow lump 
of conceit! 

conrucius. Only an Englishman could be so 
ignorant of the nature of government as to suppose that 
a capable statesman cannot be fat, yellow, and con- 
ceited. Many Englishmen are slim, red-nosed, and 
modest. Put them in my place, and within a year you 
will be back in the anarchy and chaos of the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Oh, if you go back to the dark ages, 
T have nothing more to say. But we did not perish. 
We extricated ourselves from that chaos. We are now 
the best governed country in the world. How did we 
manage that if we are such fools as you pretend? 

conFucius. You did not do it until the slaughter 
and ruin produced by your anarchy forced you at last 
to recognize two inexorable facts. First, that govern- 
ment is absolutely necessary to civilization, and that you 
could not maintain civilization by merely doing down 
your neighbor, as you called it, and cutting off the head 
of your king whenever he happened to be a logical Scot 
and tried to take his position seriously. Second, that 
government is an art of which you are congenitally in- 


Part III The Thing Happens 111 


capable. Accordingly, you imported educated negresses 
and Chinese to govern you. Since then you have done 
very well. 

BURGE-LUBIN. So have you, you old humbug. All 
the same, I dont know how you stand the work you do. 
You seem to me positively to like public business. Why 
wont you let me take you down to the coast some week- 
end and teach you marine golf? 

conFuctus. It does not interest me. I am not a 
barbarian. 

BURGE-LUBIN. You mean that I am? 

conFucius. That is evident. 

BURGE-LUBIN. How? 

conrucius. People like you. They like cheerful 
good-natured barbarians. They have elected you Presi- 
dent five times in succession. ‘They will elect you five 
times more. I like you. You are better company than 
a dog or a horse because you can speak, 

BURGE-LUBIN. Am [I a barbarian because you like 
me? 

conrucius. Surely. Nobody likes me: I am held in 
awe. Capable persons are never liked. I am not like 
able; but I am indispensable. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Oh, cheer up, old man; theres nothing 
so disagreeable about you as all that. I dont dislike 
you; and if you think I’m afraid of you, you jolly well 
dont know Burge-Lubin: thats all. 

conrucius. You are brave: yes. It is a form of 
stupidity. 

BURGE-LUBIN. You may not be brave; one doesnt 
expect it from a Chink. But you have the devil’s own 
cheek. 

conructus. I have the assured certainty of the man 
who sees and knows. Your genial bluster, your cheery 
self-confidence, are pleasant, like the open air. But they 


112 The Thing Happens Part III 


are blind: they are vain. I seem to see a great dog wag 
his tail and bark joyously. But if he leaves my heel he 
is lost. 

BURGE-LUBIN. ‘Thank you for a handsome compli- 
ment. I have a big dog; and he is the best fellow I 
know. If you knew how much uglier you are than a 
chow, you wouldn’t start those comparisons, though. 
[Rising] Well, if you have nothing for me to do, I am 
going to leave your heel for the rest of the day and 
enjoy myself. What would you recommend me to do 
with myself? 

conrucius. Give yourself up to contemplation; and 
great thoughts will come to you. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Will they? If you think I am going 
to sit here on a fine day like this with my legs crossed 
waiting for great thoughts, you exaggerate my taste 
for them. I prefer marine golf. [Stopping short] Oh, 
by the way, I forgot something. I have a word or two 
to say to the Minister of Health. [He goes back to his 
chair). 

conrucius. Her number is— 

BURGE-LUBIN. I know it. 

conFucius [rising] I cannot understand her attrac- 
tion for you. For me a woman who is not yellow does 
not exist, save as an Official. [He goes out]. 

Burge-Lubin operates the .switchboard as before. 
The screen vanishes; and a dainty room with a bed, a 
wardrobe, and a dressing-table with a mirror and a 
switch on wt, appears. Seated at it a handsome negress 
is trying on a brilliant head scarf. Her dressing-gown 
ts thrown back from her shoulders to her chair. She is 
in corset, knickers, and silk stockings. 

BURGE-LUBIN [horrified] I beg your pardon a thou- 
sand times— [The startled negress snatches the peg out 
of her switchboard and vanishes].

THE NEGRESS’S VOICE. Who it is? 

BURGE-LUBIN. ‘Me. The President. Burge-Lubin. 
I had no idea your bedroom switch was in. I beg your 
pardon. 

Phe negress reappears. She has pulled the dress- 
ing-gown perfunctorily over her shoulders, and continues 
her experiments with the scarf, not at all put out, and 
rather amused by Burge’s prudery. 

THE NEGRESS. Stupid of me. I was talking to an- 
other lady this morning; and I left the peg in. 

BURGE-LUBIN. But I am so sorry. 

THE NEGEESS [sunnily: still busy with the scarf] 
Why? It was my fault. 

BURGE-LUBIN [embarrassed| Well—er—er— But I 
suppose you were used to it in Africa. 

THE NEGRESS. Your delicacy is very touching, Mr 
President. It would be funny if it were not so un- 
pleasant, because, like all white delicacy, it is in the 
wrong place. How do you think this suits my com- 
plexion? 

BURGE-LUBIN. How can any really vivid color go 
wrong with a black satin skin? It is our women’s 
wretched pale faces that have to be matched and lighted. 
Yours is always right. 

THE NEGREsS. Yes: it is a pity your white beauties 
have all the same ashy faces, the same colorless drab, the 
same age. But look at their beautiful noses and little 
lips! They are physically insipid: they have no beauty: 
you cannot love them; but how elegant! 

BURGE-LUBIN. Cant you find an official pretext for 
coming to see me? Isnt it ridiculous that we have never 
met? It’s so tantalizing to see you and talk to you, and 
to know all the time that you are two hundred miles 


away, and that I cant touch you? a

hard enough to keep my blood warm here. Besides, my 
friend, it would not be safe. ‘These distant flirtations 
are very charming; and they teach self-control. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Damn self-control! I want to hold 
you in my arms—to— [the negress snatches out the peg 
from the switchboard and vanishes. She is still heard 
laughing]. Black devil! [He snatches out his peg 
furiously; her laugh is no longer heard}. Oh, these sex 
episodes! Why can I not resist them? Disgraceful! 

Confucius returns. 

conrucius. I forgot. There is something for you 
to do this morning. You have to go to the Record Office 
to receive the American barbarian. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Confucius: once for all, I object to 
this Chinese habit of describing white men as barbarians. 

conFuctius [standing formally at the end of the table 
with his hands palm to palm] I make a mental note 
that you do not wish the Americans to be described as 
barbarians. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Not at all. The Americans are bar- 
barians. But we are not. I suppose the particular 
barbarian you are speaking of.is the American who has 
invented a means of breathing under water. 

conrucius. He says he has invented such a method. 
For some reason which is not intelligible in China, 
Englishmen always believe any statement made by an 
American inventor, especially one who has never invented 
anything. ‘Therefore you believe this person and have 
given him a public reception. Today the Record Office 
is entertaining him with a display of the cinemato- 
graphic records of all the eminent Englishmen who have 
lost their lives by drowning since the cinema was in- 
vented. Why not go to see it if you are at a loss for 
‘pmething to do? 

BURGE-LUBIN. What earthly interest is there in look- 


Part III ‘The ‘Lhing Happens 115 


ing at a moving picture of a lot of people merely be- 
cause they were drowned? If they had had any sense, 
they would not have been drowned, probably. 

conFrucius. That is not so. It has never been 
noticed before; but the Record Office has just made two 
remarkable discoveries about the public men and women 
who have displayed extraordinary ability during the 
past century. One is that they retained unusual youth- 
fulness up to an advanced age. The other Is that they 
all met their death by drowning. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Yes:I know. Can you explain it? 

conrucius. It cannot be explained. It is not 
reasonable. ‘Therefore I do not believe it. 

The Accountant General rushes in, looking ghastly. 
He staggers to the middle of the table, 

BURGE-LUBIN. Whats the matter? Are you ill? 

BARNABAS [choking | No. I— [he collapses mto the 
middle chair|. I must speak to you in private. 

Confucius calmly withdrawns. 

BURGE-LUBIN. What on earth is it? Have some 
oxygen. 

BARNABAS. I have had some. Go to the Record 
Office. You will see men fainting there again and again, 
and being revived with oxygen, as I have been. They 
have seen with their own eyes as I have. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Seen what? 

BARNABAS. Seen the Archbishop of York. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Well, why shouldnt they see the 
Archbishop of York? What are they fainting for? 
Flas he been murdered? 

Barnabas. No: he has been drowned. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Good God! Where? When? How? 
Poor fellow!

ler! Poor robber of his country’s Exchequer! Poor 
fellow indeed! Wait til I catch him. 

BURGE-LUBIN. How can you catch him when he is 
dead? Youre mad. 

BARNABAS. Dead! Who said he was dead? 

BURGE-LUBIN. You did. Drowned. 

BaRNnaBas [exasperated] Will you listen tome? Was 
old Archbishop Haslam, the present man’s last prede- 
cessor but four, drowned or not? 

BURGE-LUBIN. I dont know. Look him up in the 
Encyclopedia Britannica. 

BARNABAS. Yah! Was Archbishop Stickit, who 
wrote Stickit on the Psalms, drowned or not? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Yes, mercifully. He deserved it. 

BARNABAS. Was President Dickenson drowned? Was 
General Bullyboy drowned? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Who is denying it? 

BARNABAS. Well, weve had moving pictures of all 
four put on the screen today for this American; and 
they and the Archbishop are the same man. Now tell 
me I am mad.

raving mad.

holding it down] Send the Archbishop in at once. 

BURGE-LUBIN. If you lose your temper, Barnabas, 
remember that we shall be two to one. 

The Archbishop enters. He has a white band round 
his throat, set in a black stock. He wears a sort of kilt 
of black ribbons, and soft black boots that button high 
up on his calves. His costume does not differ otherwise 
from that of the President and the Accountant General; 
but its color scheme is black and white. He is older than 
the Reverend Bill Haslam was when he woed Miss Savoy 
Barnabas; but he is recognizably the same man. He 
does not look a day over fifty, and is very well preserved 
even at that; but his boyishness of manner ts quite gone: 
he now has complete authority and self-possession: im 
fact the President is a little afraid of him; and tt seems 
quite natural and inevitable that he should speak first. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Good day, Mr President. 

BUBGE-LUBIN. Good day, Mr Archbishop. Be seated. 

THE ARCHBISHOP [sifting down between them] Good 
day, Mr Accountant General. 

BaRnaBas [malevolenily| Good day to you. I havea 
question to put to you, if you dont mind. 

THE ARCHBISHOP [looking curiously at him, jarred by 
his uncivil tone] Certainly. What is it? 

BARNABAS. What is your definition of a thief? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Rather an old-fashioned word, is 
it not? 

BARNABAS. It survives officially in my department. 

THE ARCHBIsHoP. Our departments are full of sur- 
vivals. Look at my tie! my apron! my boots! They 
are al] mere survivals; yet it seems that without them I 
cannot be a proper Archbishop. 

BARNARAS. Indeed! Well, in my department the 
word thief survives, because in the community the thing 


118 The Thing Happens Part III 


thief survives. And a very despicable and dishonorable 
thing he is, too. 

THE ARCHBISHOP [coolly] I daresay. 

BagNaBaS. In my department, sir, a thief is a per- 
son who lives longer than the statutory expectation of 
life entitles him to, and goes on drawing public money | 
when, if he were an honest man, he would be dead. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. ‘Then let me say, sir, that your 
department does not understand its own business. If you 
have miscalculated the duration of human life, that is 
not the fault of the persons whose longevity you have 
miscalculated. And if they continue to work and pro- 
duce, they pay their way, even if they live two or three 
centuries, 

BARNABAS. I know nothing about their working and 
producing. That is not the business of my department. 
I am concerned with their expectation of life; and I say 
that no man has any right to go on living and drawing 
money when he ought to be dead. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. You do not comprehend the rela- 
tion between income and production. 

BARNABAS. I[ understand my own department. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. ‘That is not enough. Your de- 

partment is part of a synthesis which embraces all the 
departments, 
_ BURGE-LUBIN. Synthesis! This is an intellectual 
difficulty. This is a job for Confucius. I heard him 
use that very word the other day; and I wondered what 
the devil he meant. [Switching on] Hallo! Put me 
through to the Chief Secretary. 

CONFUCIUS’s voicz. You are speaking to him. 

BURGE-LUBIN. An intellectual difficulty, old mar. 
Something we dont understand. Come and help us out. 


THE ARCHBISHOP. May I ask how the question has 
arisen ? 


Part III The Thing Happens 119 


BARNABAS. Ah! You begin to smell a rat, do you? 
You thought yourself pretty safe. You— 

BURGE-LUBIN. Steady, Barnabas. Dont be in a 
hurry. 

Confucius enters. 

THE ARCHBISHOP [rising | Good morning, Mr Chief 
Secretary. 

BURGE-LUBIN [rising im instinctive imitation of the 
Archbishop | Honor us by taking a seat, O sage. 

conFucius. Ceremony is needless. [He bows to the 
company and takes the chair at the foot of the table]. 

The President and the Archbishop resume their 
seats. 

BURGE-LUBIN. We wish to put a case to you, Con- 
fucius. Suppose a man, instead of conforming to the 
official estimate of his expectation of life, were to live 
for more than two centuries and a half, would the 
Accountant General be justified in calling him a thief? 

conrucius. No. He would be justified in calling 
him a har. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. I think not, Mr Chief Secretary. 
What do you suppose my age is? 

conFucius. Fifty. 

BURGE-LUBIN. You dont look it. Forty-five; and 
young for your age. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. My age is two hundred and 
eighty-three. 

paznazas [morosely triumphant] Hmp! Mad, am I? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Youre both mad. Excuse me, Arch- 
bishop; but this is getting a bit—well— 

THE ARCHBISHOP [to Confucius] Mr Chief Secretary: 
will you, to oblige me, assume that I have lived nearly 
three centuries? As a hypothesis. 

BURGE-LUBIN. What is a hypothesis? 

conrucius. It does not matter. I understand. [To 


120 The Thing Happens Part III 
the Archbishop| Am I to assume that you have lived in 


your ancestors, or by metempsychosis— 

BURGE-LUBIN. Met—Emp—Sy— Good Lord! What 
a brain, Confucius! What a brain! 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Nothing of that kind. Assume in 
the ordinary sense that I was born in the year 1887, and 
that I have worked continuously in one profession or 
another since the year 1910. Am I a thief? 

conrucius. I do not know. Was that one of your 
professions? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. No. I have been nothing worse 
than an Archbishop, a President, and a General. 

BARNABAS. Has he or has he not robbed the Ex- 
chequer by drawing five or six incomes when he was only 
entitled to one? Answer me that. 

conrucius. Certainly not. The hypothesis is that 
he has worked continuously since 1910. We are now in 
the year 2170. What is the official lifetime? 

BARNABAS. Seventy-eight. Of course it’s an ave- 
rage; and we dont mind a man here and there going on 
to ninety, or even, as a curiosity, becoming a cente- 
narian. But I say that a man who goes beyond that is 
a swindler. 

conFucius. Seventy-eight into two hundred and 
eighty-three goes more than three and a half times. 
Your department owes the Archbishop two and a half 
educations and three and a half retiring pensions. 

BARNABAS. Stuff! How can that be? 

conrucius. At what age do your people begin to 

work for the community? 
1, BURGE-LUBIN. ‘Three. They do certain things every 
day when they are three. Just to break them in, you 
know. But they become self-supporting, or nearly so, at 
thirteen. 


conrucius. ‘And at what age do they retire? 


Part III The Thing Happens 121 


BARNABAS. Forty-three. 

conrucius. ‘That is, they do thirty years’ work; and 
they receive maintenance and education, without work- 
ing, for thirteen years of childhood and thirty-five years 
of superannuation, forty-eight years in all, for each 
thirty years’ work. The Archbishop has given you 260 
years’ work, and has received only one education and no 
superannuation. You therefore owe him over 300 years 
of leisure and nearly eight educations. You are thus 
heavily in his debt. In other words, he has effected an 
enormous national economy by living so long; and you, 
by living only seventy-eight years, are profiting at his 
expense. He is the benefactor: you are the thief. 
[Half rising] May I now withdraw and return to my 
serious business, as my own span is comparatively short. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Dont be in a hurry, old chap. [Con- 
fucius sits down again]. ‘This hypothecary, or what- 
ever you call it, is put up seriously. I dont believe it; 
but if the Archbishop and the Accountant General are 
going to insist that it’s true, we shall have either to 
lock them up or to see the thing through. 

BARNABAS. It’s no use trying these Chinese subtleties 
on me. I’m a plain man; and though I dont understand 
metaphysics, and dont believe in them, I understand 
figures; and if the Archbishop is only entitled to 
seventy-eight years, and he takes 283, I say he takes 
more than he is entitled to. Get over that if you can. 

THE ancHBIsHOP. I have not taken 283 years: I 
have taken 23 and given 260. 

conrucius. Do your accounts shew a deficiency or a 
surplus? 

paRNaBas. Asurplus. Thats what I cant make out. 
Thats the artfulness of these people. 

BURGE-LUBIN. ‘That settles it. Whats the use of 


122 The Thing Happens Part III 


arguing? ‘The Chink says you are wrong; and theres 
an end of it. 

BARNABAS. I say nothing against the Chink’s argu- 
ments. But what about my facts? 

conFrucius. If your facts include a case of a man 
living 283 years, I advise you to take a few weeks at the 
seaside, 

BARNABAS. Let there be an end of this hinting that 
I am out of my mind. Come and look at the cinema 
record. I tell you this man is Archbishop Haslam, 
Archbiship Stickit, President Dickenson, General Bully- 
boy and himself into the bargain: all five of them. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. I do not deny it. I never have 
denied it. Nobody has ever asked me. 

BURGE-LUBIN. But damn it, man—JI beg your par- 
don, Archbishop ; but really, really— 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Dont mention it. What were you 
going to say? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Well, you were drowned four times 
over. You are not a cat, you know. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. ‘That is very easy to understand. 

Consider my situation when I first made the amazing 
discovery that I was destined to live three hundred 
years! [— 
_ conFucius [interrupting him] Pardon me. Such a 
discovery was impossible. You have not made it yet. 
You may live a million years if you have already lived 
two hundred. ‘There is no question of three hundred 
years. You have made a slip at the very beginning of 
your fairy tale, Mr Archbishop. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Good, Confucius! [To the Arch- 
bishop | He has you there. I dont see how you can get 
over that. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Yes: itis quitea oint. But 
if the Accountant General will pai tit a British 


Part III The Thing Happens 123 


Museum library, and search the catalogue, he will find 
under his own name a curious and now forgotten book, 
dated 1924, entitled The Gospel of the Brothers Bar- 
nabas. That gospel was that men must live three hun- 
dred years if civilization is to be saved. It shewed that 
this extension of individual human life was possible, and 
how it was likely to come about. I married the daugh- 
ter of one of the brothers. 

BARNABAS. Do you mean to say you claim to be a 
connection of mine? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. I claim nothing. As I have by 
this time perhaps three or four million cousins of one 
degree or another, I have ceased to call on the family. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Gracious heavens! Four million rela- 
tives! Is that calculation correct, Confucius? 

conFucius. In China it might be forty millions if 
there were no checks on population. 

BURGE-LUBIN. ‘This is a staggerer. It brings home 
to one—but [recovering] it isn’t true, you know. Let 
us keep sane. 

conFucivs [to the Archbishop] You wish us to under- 
stand that the illustrious ancestors of the Accountant 
General communicated to you a secret by which you 
could attain the age of three hundred years, : 

THE ARCHBISHOP. No. Nothing of the kind. They 
simply believed that mankind could live any length of 
time it knew to be absolutely necessary to save civiliza- 
tion from extinction. I did not share their belief: at 
least I was not conscious of sharing it: I thought I was 
only amused by it. To me my father-in-law and his 
brother were a pair of clever cranks who had talked one 
another into a fixed idea which had become a monomania 
with them. It was not until I got into serious difficulties 
with the pension authorities after turning seventy that 
I began to suspect the truth. 


124 The Thing Happens Part III 


conFucius. The truth? 

THE arcuBisHorp. Yes, Mr Chief Secretary: the 
truth. Like all revolutionary truths, it began as a joke. 
‘As I shewed no signs of ageing after forty-five, my wife 
used to make fun of me by saying that I was certainly 
going to live three hundred years. She was sixty-eight 
when she died; and the last thing she said to me, as I 
sat by her bedside holding her hand, was “Bull: you 
really dont look fifty. I wonder—” She broke off, and 
fell asleep wondering, and never awoke. Then I began 
to wonder too. That is the explanation of the three 
hundred years, Mr Secretary. 

conFrucius. It is very ingenious, Mr Archbishop. 
‘And very well told. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Of course you understand that J dont 
for a moment suggest the very faintest doubt of your 
absolute veracity, Archbishop. You know that, dont 
you? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Quite, Mr President. Only you 
dont believe me: that is all. I do not expect you to. In 
your place I should not believe. You had better have a 
look at the films. [Pointing to the Accountant General] 
He believes, 

BURGE-LUBIN. But the drowning? What about the 
drowning? A man might get drowned once, or even 
twice if he was exceptionally careless. But he couldn't 
be drowned four times. He would run away from water 
like a mad dog. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Perhaps Mr Chief Secretary can 
guess the explanation of that. 

conFucius. To keep your secret, you had to die. 

BURGE-LUBIN. But dash it all, man, he isnt dead. 

conFucivs. It is socially impossible not to do what 
everybody else does. One must die at the usual time, 

BARNABAS. Of course. A simple point of honor. 


Part III The Thing Happens 125 


conFucius. Notatall. <A simple necessity. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Well, I’m hanged if I see it. I should 
jolly well live for ever if I could. 

THE ARCHBIsHOP. It is not so easy as you think. 
You, Mr Chief Secretary, have grasped the difficulties 
of the position. Let me remind you, Mr President, that 
I was over eighty before the 1969 Act for the Redistri- 
bution of Income entitled me to a handsome retiring 
pension. Owing to my youthful appearance I was 
prosecuted for attempting to obtain public money on 
false pretences when I claimed it. I could prove nothing; 
for the register of my birth had been blown to pieces by 
a bomb dropped on a village church years before in the 
first of the big modern wars. I was ordered back to 
work as a man of forty, and had to work for fifteen 
years more, the retiring age being then fifty-five. 

BURGE-LUBIN. As late as fifty-five! How did people 
stand it? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. ‘They made difficulties about let- 
ting me go even then, I still looked so young. For some 
years I was in continual trouble. The industrial police 
rounded me up again and again, refusing to believe that 
I was over age. They began to call me the Wandering 
Jew. You see how impossible my position was. I fore- 
saw that in twenty years more my official record would 
prove me to be seventy-five; my appearance would make 
it impossible to believe that I was more than forty-five; 
and my real age would be one hundred and seventeen. 
What was Ito do? Bleach my hair? Hobble about on 
two sticks? Mimic the voice of a centenarian? Better 
have killed myself. 

BARNABAS. You ought to have killed yourself. As 
an honest man you were entitled to no more than an 
honest man’s expectation of life. 

THE arcuBisHop. [ did kill myself. It was quite 


126 The Thing Happens Part III 


easy. I left a suit of clothes by the seashore during the 
bathing season, with documents in the pockets to 
identify me. I then turned up in a strange place, pre- 
tending that I had lost my memory, and did not know 
my name or my age or anything about myself. Under 
treatment I recovered my health, but not my memory. 
I have had severa] careers since I began this routine of 
life and death. I have been an archbishop three times. 
When I persuaded the authorities to knock down all our 
towns and rebuild them from the foundations, or move 
them, I went into the artillery, and became a general. I 
have been President. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Dickenson? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Yes, 

BURGE-LUBIN. But they found Dickenson’s body: its 
ashes are buried in St. Paul’s. 

THE agcHBIsHOP. They almost always found the 
body. During the bathing season there are plenty of 
bodies. I have been cremated again and again. At first 
I used to attend my own funeral in disguise, because I 
had read about a man doing that in an old romance by 
an author named Bennett, from whom I remember bor- 
rowing five pounds in 1912. But I got tired of that. I 
would not cross the street now to read my latest epitaph. 

The Chief Secretary and the President look very 
glum. Their incredulity is vanquished at last. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Look here. Do you chaps realize how 
awful this is? Here we are sitting calmly in the presence 
of a man whose death is overdue by two centuries. He 
may crumble into dust before our eyes at any moment. 

BARNABAS. Not he. He'll go on drawing his pen- 
sion until the end of the world. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Not quite that. My expectation 
of life is only,three hundred years. 


Part III The Thing Happens 127 


BARNABAS, You will last out my time anyhow: thats 
enough for me. 

THE ARCHBISHOP [coolly] How do you know? 

BARNABAS [taken aback] How do I know! 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Yes: how do you know? I did not 
begin even to suspect until I was nearly seventy. I was 
only vain of my youthful appearance. I was not quite 
serious about it until I was ninety. Even now I am not 
sure from one moment to another, though I have given 
you my reason for thinking that I have quite uninten- 
tionally committed myself to a lifetime of three hundred 
years. 

BURGE-LUBIN. But how do you doit? Is it lemons? 
Is it Soya beans? Is it— 

THE ARCHBISHOP. I do not doit. It happens. It 
may happen to anyone. It may happen to you. 

BURGE-LUBIN | the full significance of this for himself 
dawning on him] Then we three may be in the same boat 
with you, for all we know? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Youmay. Therefore I advise you 
to be very careful how you take any step that will make 
my position uncomfortable. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Well, I’m dashed! One of my secre- 
taries was remarking only this morning how well and 
young I am looking. Barnabas: I have an absolute con- 
viction that I am one of the—the—shall I say one of 
the victims?—of this strange destiny. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Your great-great-great-great- 
great-great-grandfather formed the same conviction 
when he was between sixty and seventy. I knew him. 

BURGE-LUBIN [depressed] Ah! But he died. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. No. ; 

nuRcE-LUBIN [hopefully] Do you mean to say he is 


still alive? 
THE aRcHBIsHOP. No. He was shot. Under the in- 


128 The Thing Happens Part III 


fluence of his belief that he was going to live three hun- 
dred years he became a changed man. He began to tell 
people the truth; and they disliked it so much that they 
took advantage of certain clauses of an Act of Parlia- 
ment he had himself passed during the Four Years War, 
and had purposely forgotten to repeal afterwards. 
They took him to the Tower of London and shot him. 

[The apparatus rings. | 

conFucius [answering] Yes? [He listens. ] 

A WOMAN’s VoicE. The Domestic Minister has called. 

BURGE-LUBIN [not quite catching the answer] Who 
does she say had called? 

conFucius. 'The Domestic Minister. 

BARNABAS. Oh, dash it! That awful woman! 

BURGE-LUBIN. She certainly is a bit of a terror. I 
dont know exactly why; for she is not at all bad-looking. 

BARNABAS [out of patience] For Heaven’s sake, dont 
be frivolous. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. He cannot help it, Mr Accountant 
General. ‘Three of his sixteen great-great-great-grand- 
fathers married Lubins. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Tut tut! Iam not frivolling. J did 
not ask the lady here. Which of you did? 

conFucius. It is her official duty to report person- 
ally to the President once a quarter. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Oh, that! Then I suppose it’s my 
official duty to receive her. Theyd better send her in. 
You dont mind, do you? She will bring us back to real 
life. I dont know how you fellows feel; but I’m just 
going dotty.

They watch the door in silence for the entrance of 
the Domestic Minister.

BURGE-LUBIN [suddenly, to the Archbishop] I sup- 
pose you have been married over and over again. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Once. You do not make vows 
until death when death is three hundred years off, 

They relapse into uneasy silence. The Domestic 
Minister enters. She is a handsome woman, apparently 
in the prime of life, with elegant, tense, well held-up 
figure, and the walk of a goddess. Her expression and 
deportment are grave, swift, decisive, awful, unanswer- 
able. She wears a Dianesque tunic instead of a blouse, 
and a silver coronet instead of a gold fillet. Her dress 
otherwise is not markedly different from that of the men, 
who rise as she enters, and incline their heads with in-~ 
stinctive awe. She comes to the vacant chair between 
Barnabas and Confucius. 

BURGE-LUBIN [resolutely genial and gallant] De- 
lighted to see you, Mrs Lutestring. 

conrucius. We are honored by your celestial 
presence. 

BARNABAS. Good day, madam. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. I have not had the pleasure of 
meeting you before. I am the Archbishop of York.

They all stt down. 

THE ARCHBISHOP [also puzzled] Are you sure you are

Mrs Lutestring. Something like a door opening con- 
tmually and revealing you. And a smile of welcome 
when you recognized me. Did you ever open a door for 
me, I wonder? 

MRS LUTESTRING. I often opened a door for the per-

dead many years. 

The rest, except the Archbishop, look at one another 
quickly.

MES LUTESTRING | struck by his tone, looks at him for 
a moment with some displeasure; then replies} It does 
not matter. A long time. 

BURGE-LUBIN. You mustnt rush to conclusions about 
the Archbishop, Mrs Lutestring. He is an older bird 
than you think. Older than you, at all events. | 

MES LUTESTRING [with a melancholy smile| I think 
not, Mr President. But the subject is a delicate one. 
I had rather not pursue it. 

conrucius. ‘There is a question which has not been 
asked. 

MRS LUTESTRING [very decisively} If it is a question 
about my age, Mr Chief Secretary, it had better not be 
asked. All that concerns you about my personal affairs 
can be found in the books of the Accountant General. 

conFucius. ‘The question I was thinking of will not 
be addressed to you. But let me say that your sen- 
sitiveness on the point is very strange, coming from a 
woman so superior to all common weaknesses as we know 
you to be. 

MES LUTESTRING. I may have reasons which have 
nothing to do with common weaknesses, Mr Chief Secre- 
tary. I hope you will respect them. — 

conFucius [after bowing to her in assent] I will now 
put my question. Have you, Mr Archbishop, any 
ground for assuming, as you seem to do, that what has 
eae to you has not happened to other people as 
well? 

reve Yes, by George! I never thought of 
that. 


Part III The Thing Happens 131 


THE ARCHBISHOP. J have never met any case but 
my own. 

conFrucius. ‘How do you know? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Well, no one has ever told me that 
they were in this extraordinary position. 

conFucius. ‘That proves nothing. Did you ever tell 
anybody that you were init? You never told us. Why 
did you never tell us? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. I am surprised at the question, 
coming from so astute a mind as yours, Mr Secretary. 
When you reach the age I reached before I discovered 
what was happening to me, I was old enough to know 
and fear the ferocious hatred with which human ani- 
mals, like all other animals, turn upon any unhappy 
individual who has the misfortune to be unlike themselves 
in every respect: to be unnatural, as they call it. You 
will still find, among the tales of that twentieth-century 
classic, Wells, a story of a race of men who grew twice as 
big as their fellows, and another story of a man who fell 
into the hands of a race of blind men. The big people 
had to fight the little people for their lives; and the 
man with eyes would have had his eyes put out by the 
blind had he not fled to the desert, where he perished 
miserably. Wells’s teaching, on that and other matters, 
was not lost on me. By the way, he lent me five pounds 
once which I never repaid; and it still troubles my 
conscience. 

conrucius. And were you the only reader of Wells? 
If there were others like you, had they not the same 
reason for keeping the secret? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. That is true. But I should know. 
You short-lived people are so childish. If I met a man 
of my own age I should recognize him at once. I have 
never done so. 


132 The Thing Happens Part III 


MES LUTESTRING. Would you recognize a woman of 
your age, do you think? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. I—[He stops and turns upon her 
with a searching look, startled by the suggestion and the 
suspicion it rouses]. 

MES LUTESTRING. What is your age, Mr Archbishop? 

BURGE-LUBIN. ‘Two hundred and eighty-three, he 
says. That is his little joke. Do you know, Mrs Lute- 
string, he had almost talked us into believing him when 
you came in and cleared the air with your robust common 
sense, 

MES LUTESTRBING. Do you really feel that, Mr Presi- 
dent? I hear the note of breezy assertion in your voice. 
I miss the note of conviction. 

BURGE-LUBIN [jumping up] Look here. Let us stop 
talking damned nonsense. I dont wish to be disagree- 
able; but it’s getting on my nerves. The best joke wont 
bear being pushed beyond a certain point. That point 
has been reached. I—IJ’m rather busy this morning. 
We all have our hands pretty full. Confucius here will 
tell you that I have a heavy day before me. 

BARNABAS. Have you anything more important than 
this thing, if it’s true? 

BUBGE-LUBIN. Oh, if,if,if it’s true! Butitisn’t true. 

BARNABAS. Have you anything at all to do? | 

BURGE-LUBIN. Anything todo! Have you forgotten, 
Barnabas, that I happen to be President, and that the 
weight of the entire public business of this country is on 
my shoulders? 

BARNABAS. Has he anything to do, Confucius? 

conFucius. He has to be President. 

BARNABAS. 'That means that he has nothing to do.

‘You obscure the discussion in using them. 

BARNABAS [ glad to escape from her gaze by address- 
tng Confucius | Well, this unnatural horror. Will that 
satisfy you? 

conrucius. That is in order. But we do not com- 
mit ourselves to the implications of the word horror. 

THE ARCHBISHOP, By the word ‘horror the Account- 
and General means only something unusual. 

conFucius. I notice that the honorable Domestic 
Minister, on learning the advanced age of the venerable 
prelate, shews no sign of surprise or incredulity. 

BURGE-LUBIN. She doesnt take it seriously. Who 
would? Eh, Mrs Lutestring? 

MRS LUTEsTRING. I take it very seriously indeed, Mr 
President. I see now that I was not mistaken at first. I 
have met the Archbishop before. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. I felt sure of it. This vision of a 
door opening to me, and a woman’s face welcoming me, 
must be a reminiscence of something that really hap- 
pened; though I see it now as an angel opening the 
gate of heaven. 

MRS LUTESTRING. Or a parlormaid opening the door 
of the house of the young woman you were in love with? 

THE ARCHBISHOP [making a wry face] Is that the 
reality? How these things grow in our imagination! 
But may I say, Mrs Lutestring, that the transfigura- 
tion of a parlormaid to an angel is not more amazing 
than her transfiguration to the very dignified and able 
Domestic Minister I am addressing. I recognize the 


134 The Thing Happens Part III 


angel in you. Frankly, I do not recognize the pazlor- 
maid. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Whats a parlormaid? 

MRS LUTESTRING. An extinct species. A woman ina 
black dress and white apron, who opened the house door 
when people knocked or rang, and was either your tyrant 
or your slave. I was a parlormaid in the house of one 
of the Accountant General’s remote ancestors. [ TJ'o Con-

him] Look again, Mr President. 

BURGE-LUBIN [looking at her bravely until the smile 
fades from his face, and he suddenly covers his eyes with 
his hands] Yes: you do look it. I am convinced. It’s 
true. Now call up the Lunatic Asylum, Confucius; and 
tell them to send an ambulance for me. 

MRS LUTESTRING [to the Archbishop] Why have you 
given away your secret? our secret? 

THE ARCHBISHOP. They found it out. The cinema 
records betrayed me. But I never dreamt that there 
were others. Did you? 

MRS LUTESTRING. I knew one other. She was a cook. 
She grew tired, and killed herself, 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Dear me! However, her death 
simplifies the situation, as I have been able to convince 
a gentlemen that the matter had better go no fur- 

er. 

MES LUTESTRING. What! When the President knows! 
It will be all over the place before the end of the week. 

BURGE-LUBIN [injured] Really, Mrs Lutestring! You

BARNABAS [resignedly] It cant be helped. It’s consti-

you say, it cannot be helped. 

BURGE-LUBIN [solemnly] I deny that a secret of State 
has ever passed my lips—except perhaps to the Minister 
of Health, who is discretion personified. People think, be- 
cause she is a negress— 

MES LUTEsTRING. It does not matter much now. 
Once, it would have mattered a great deal. But my 
children are all dead. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Yes: the children must have been a 
terrible difficulty. Fortunately for me, I had none. 

MRS LUTESTRING. ‘There was one daughter who was 
the child of my very heart. Some years after my first 
drowning I learnt that she had lost her sight. I went to 
her. She was an old woman of ninety-six, blind. She 
asked me to sit and talk with her because my voice was 
like the voice of her dead mother. 

BURGE-LUBIN. ‘The complications must be frightful. 
Really I hardly know whether I do want to live much 
longer than other people. 

MES LUTESTRING. You can always kill yourself, as 
cook did; but that was influenza. Long life is compli- 
cated, and even terrible; but it is glorious all the same. 
I would no more change places with an ordinary woman 
than with a mayfly that lives only an hour. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. What set you thinking of it first? 

MES LUTESTRING. Conrad Barnabas’ book. Your wife 
told me it was more wonderful than Napoleon’s Book of 
Fate and Old Moore’s Almanac, which cook and I used 
to read. I was very ignorant: it did not seem so impos- 
sible to me as to an educated woman. Yet I forgot all 
about it, and married and drudged as a poor man’s wife, 


136 The Thing Happens Part III 


and brought up children, and looked twenty years older 
than I really was, until one day, long after my husband 
died and my children were out in the world working for 
themselves, I noticed that I looked twenty years younger 
than I really was. The truth came to me in a flash. 

BURGE-LUBIN. An amazing) moment. Your feelings 
must ‘have been beyond description. What was your first 
thought? 

MRS LUTESTRING. Pure terror. I saw that the litile 
money I had laid up would not last, and that I must go 
out and work again. They had things called Old Age 
Pensions then: miserable pittances for worn-out old 
laborers to die on. I thought I should be found out if 
I went on drawing it too long. The horror of facing 
another lifetime of drudgery, of missing my hard-earned 
rest and losing my poor little savings, drove everything 
else out of my mind. You people nowadays can have 
no conception of the dread of poverty that hung over 
us then, or of the utter tiredness of forty years’ unend- 
Ing overwork and striving to make a shilling do the work 
of a pound. 

THE ARCHBIsHOP. I wonder you did not kill yourself. 
I often wonder why the poor in those evil old times did 
not kill themselves, They did not even kill other people. 

MRS LUTEsTRING. You never kill yourself, because 
you always may as well wait until tomorrow. And you 
have not energy or conviction enough to kill the others. 
Besides, how can you blame them when you would do as 
they do if you were in their place? 

BURGE-LUBIN, Devilish poor consolation, that. 

__ MBS LUTEsTRING. ‘There were other consolations in 
those days for people like me. We drank preparations 
of alcohol to relieve the strain of living and give us an 
artificial happiness.

MES LUTESTRING. A little alcohol would improve your 
temper and manners, and make you much easier to live 
with, Mr Accountant General. 

BURGE-LUBIN [laughing] By George, I believe you! 
Try it, Barnabas. 

conrucius. No. Try tea. It is the more civilized 
poison of the two. 

MRS LUTESTRING. You, Mr President, were born in- 
toxicated with your own well-fed natural exuberance. 
You cannot imagine what alcohol was to an underfed 
poor woman. I had carefully arranged my little savings 
so that I could get drunk, as we called it, once a week; 
and my only pleasure was looking forward to that poor 
little debauch. That is what saved me from suicide. I 
could not bear to miss my next carouse. But when I 
stopped working, and lived on my pension, the fatigue 
of my life’s drudgery began to wear off, because, you 
see, I was not really old. I recuperated. I looked 
younger and younger. And at last I was rested enough 
to have courage and strength to begin life again. Be- 
sides, political changes were making it easier: life was 
a, little better worth living for the nine-tenths of the 
people who used to be mere drudges. After that, I never 
turned back or faltered. My only regret now is that I 
shall die when I am three hundred or thereabouts. There 
was only one thing that made life hard; and that is gone 
now. 

conrucius. May we ask what that was? 

MRS LUTEsTRING. Perhaps you will be offended if I 
tell you. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Offended! My dear lady, do you sup- 
pose, after such a stupendous revelation, that anything 


138 The Thing Happens Part III 


short of a blow from a sledge-hammer could produce the 
smallest impression on any of us? 

MRS LUTESTRING. Well, you see, it has been so hard 
on me never to meet a grown-up person. You are all 
such children. And I never was very fond of children, 
except that one girl who woke up the mother passion in 
me. I have been very lonely sometimes. 

BURGE-LUBIN [again gallant] But surely, Mrs Lute- 
string, that has been your own fault. If I may say so, 
a lady of your attractions need never have been lonely. 

MRS LUTEsTRING. Why? 

BUBGE-LUBIN. Why! Well—. Well, er—. Well, 
erer—. Well! [He gives it up]. . 

THE ARCHBISHOP. He means that you might have 
married. Curious, how little they understand our posi- 
tion. 

MEs LuTESTRING. I did marry. I married again on 
my hundred and first birthday. But of course I had to 
marry an elderly man; a man over sixty. He was a 
great painter. On his deathbed he said to me “It has 
taken me fifty years to learn my trade, and to paint all 
the foolish pictures a man must paint and get rid of 
before he comes through them to the great things he 
ought to paint. And now that my foot is at last on the 
threshold of the temple I find that it is also the threshold 
of my tomb.” That man would have been the greatest 
painter of all time if he could have lived as Jong as I. 
I saw him die of old age whilst he was still, as he said 
himself, a gentleman amateur, like all modern painters. 

BURGE-LUBIN. But why had you to marry an elderly 
man? Why not marry a young one? or shall [ say a 
middle-aged one? If my own affections were not already 
engaged; and if, to tell the truth, I were not a little 
afraid of you—for you are a very superior woman, as 


Part III The Thing Happens 139 


we all acknowledge—I should esteem myself happy in— 
er—er— 

MES LUTESTRING. Mr President: have you ever tried 
to take advantage of the innocence of a little child for 
the gratification of your senses? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Good Heavens, madam, what do you 
take me for? What right have you to ask me such a 
question? 

MRS LUTESTRING. Iam at present in my two hundred 
and seventy-fifth year. You suggest that I should take 
advantage of the innocence of a child of thirty, and 
marry it. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Can you shortlived people not un- 
derstand that as the confusion and immaturity and prim- 
itive animalism in which we live for the first hundred 
years of our iife is worse in this matter of sex than in 
any other you are intolerable to us in that relation? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Do you mean to say, Mrs Lutestring, 
that you regard me as a child? 

MRS LUTESTRING. Do you expect me to regard you 
as a completed soul? Oh, you may well be afraid of me. 
There are moments when your levity, your ingratitude, 
your shallow jollity, make my gorge rise so against you 
that if I could not remind myself that you are a child I 
should be tempted to doubt your right to live at all. 

conrucius. Do you grudge us the few years we have? 
you who have three hundred! 

BURGE-LUBIN. You accuse me of levity! Must I re- 
mind you, madam, that I am the President, and that you 
are only the head of a department? 

BARNABAS. Ingratitudetoo! You draw a pension for 
three hundred years when we owe you only seventy- 
eight; and you call us ungrateful! 

urs LUTESTRING. Ido. When I think of the bless- 
ings that have been showered on you, and contrast them 


140 The Thing Happens Part III 


with the poverty! the humiliations! the anxieties! the 
heartbreak! the insolence and tyranny that were the 
daily lot of mankind when I was learning to suffer in- 
stead of learning to live! when I see how lightly you take 
it all! how you quarrel over the crumpled leaves in your 
beds of roses! how you are so dainty about your work 
that unless it is made either interesting or delightful to 
you you leave it to negresses and Chinamen, I ask my- 
self whether even three hundred years of thought and 
experience can save you from being superseded by the 
Power that created you and put you on your trial. 

BURGE-LUBIN. My dear lady: our Chinese and colored 
friends are perfectly happy. They are twenty times 
better off here than they would be in China or Liberia. 
They do their work admirably ; and in doing it they set 
us free for higher employments. 

THE ARCHBISHOP | who has caughi the infection of her 
indignation] What higher employments are you capable 
of? you that are superannuated at seventy and dead at 
eighty! 

MRS LUTESTRING. You are not really doing higher 
work, You are supposed to make the decisions and give 
the orders; but the negresses and the Chinese make up 
your minds for you and tell you what orders to give, 
just as my brother, who was a sergeant in the Guards, 
used to prompt his officers in the old days. When I 
want to get anything done at the Health Ministry I do 
not come to you: I go to the black lady who has been 
the real president during your present term of office, or 
to Confucius, who goes on for ever while presidents come 
and presidents go. 

BURGE-LUBIN. ‘This is outrageous. This is treason 
to the white race. And let me tell you, madam, that I 
have never in my life met the Minister of Health, and 
that I protest against the vulgar color prejudice which 


Part III The Thing Happens 14] 


disparages her great ability and her eminent services ta 
the State. My relations with her are purely telephonic, 
gramophonic, photophonic, and, may I add, platonic. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. There is no reason why you should 
be ashamed of them in any case, Mr President. But let 
us look at the position impersonally. Can you deny that 
what is happening is that the English people have be- 
come a Joint Stock Company admitting Asiatics and 
Africans as shareholders? 

BARNABAS. Nothing like it. I know all about the old 
joint stock companies. The shareholders did no work. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. That is true; but we, like them, 
get our dividends whether we work or not. We work 
partly because we know there would be no dividends if 
we did not, and partly because if we refuse we are re- 
garded as mentally deficient and put into a lethal cham- 
ber. But what do we work at? Before the few changes 
we were forced to make by the revolutions that followed 
the Four Years War, our governing classes had been so 
rich, as it was called, that they had become the most in- 
tellectually lazy and fat-headed people on the face of 
the earth. There is a good deal of that fat still ching- 
ing to us. 

BURGE-LUBIN. As President, IJ must not listen to un- 
patriotic criticisms of our national character, Mr Arch- 
bishop. e 

THE aRcHBIsHoP. As Archbishop, Mr President, it 
is my official duty to criticize the national character 
unsparingly. At the canonization of Saint Henrik 
Ibsen, you yourself unveiled the monument to him which 
bears on its pedestal the noble inscription, “I came not 
to call sinners, but the righteous, to repentance.” ‘The 
proof of what I say is that our routine work, and what 
may be called our ornamental and figure-head work, 18 
being more and more sought after by the English; whilst 


142 The Thing Happens Part III 


the thinking, organizing, calculating, directing work is 
done by yellow brains, brown brains, and black brains, 
just as it was done in my early days by Jewish brains, 
Scottish brains, Italian brains, German brains. The only 
white men who still do serious work are those who, like 
the Accountant General, have no capacity for enjoy- 
ment, and no social gifts to make them welcome outside 
their offices. 

BARNABAS. Confound your impudence! I had gifts 
enough to find you out, anyhow. 

THE ARCHBISHOP [disregarding this outburst] If you 
were to kill me as I stand here, you would have to appoint 
an Indian to succeed me. I take precedence to-day not 
as a Englishman, but as a man with more than a century 
and a half of fully adult experience. We are letting all 
the power slip into the hands of the colored people. In 
another hundred years we shall be simply their house- 
hold pets. 

BURGE-LUBIN [ reacting buoyantly] Not the least dan- 
ger of it. I grant you we leave the most troublesome 
part of the labor of the nation to them. And a good 
job too: why should we drudge at it? But think of the 
activities of our leisure! Is there a jollier place on earth 
to live m than England out of office hours? And to 
whom do we owe that? To ourselves, not to the niggers. 
The nigger and the Chink are all right from Tuesday 
to Friday; but from Friday to Tuesday they are simply 
nowhere: and the real life of England is from Friday 
to Tuesday. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. That is terribly true. In devising 
brainless amusements; in pursuing them with enormous 
vigor, and taking them with eager seriousness, our Eng- 
lish people are the wonder of the world. They al- 
ways were. And it is just as well; for otherwise their 
sensuality would become morbid and destroy them. 


Part III The Thing Happens 143 


What appals me is that their amusements should amuse 
them. They are the amusements of boys and girls. 
They are pardonable up to the age of fifty or sixty: 
after that they are ridiculous. I tell you, what is wron 
with us is that we are a non-adult race; and the Irish 
and the Scots, and the niggers and Chinks, as you call 
them, though their lifetime is as short as ours, or 
shorter, yet do somehow contrive to grow up a little 
before they die. We die in boyhood; the maturity that 
should make us the greatest of all the nations lies beyond 
the grave for us. Either we shall go under as grey- 
beards with golf clubs in our hands, or we must will to 
live longer. 

MES LUTESTRING. Yes: that is it. I could not have 
expressed it in words; but you have expressed it for me. 
TI felt, even when I was an ignorant domestic slave, that 
we had the possibility of becoming a great nation within 
us; but our faults and follies drove me to cynical hope- 
lessness. We all ended then like that. It is the highest 
creatures who take the longest to mature, and are the 
most helpless during their immaturity. I know now that 
it took me a whole century to grow up. I began my seri- 
ous life when I was a hundred and twenty. Asiatics can- 
not control me: I am not a child in their hands, as you 
are, Mr President. Neither, I am sure, is the Arch- 
bishop. They respect me. You are not grown up 
enough even for that, though you were kind enough to 
say that I frighten you. ; 

BURGE-LUBIN. Honestly, you do. And will you think 
me very rude if I say that if I must choose between a 
white woman old enough to be my great-grandmother 
and a black woman of my own age, I shall probably find 
the black.woman more sympathetic? 

mrs LuTEesTRiNG. And more attractive in color, per~ 


haps? 


144 The Thing Happens Part III 


BURGE-LUBIN. Yes. Since you ask me, more—well, 
not more attractive: I do not deny that-you have an 
excellent appearance—but I will say, richer. More 
Venetian. Tropical. “The shadowed livery of the bur- 
nished sun.” 

MRS LUTEsTRING. Our women, and their favorite 
story writers, begin already to talk about men with 
golden complexions. 

conFucius [expanding into a smile all across both 
face and body] A-a-a-a hf 

BUBGE-LUBIN. Well, what of it, madam? Have you 
read a very interesting book by the librarian of the Bio- 
logical Society suggesting that the future of the world 
lies with the Mulatto? 

MRS LUTESTEING [rising] Mr Archbishop: if the white 
race 1s to be saved, our destiny is apparent. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. Yes: our duty is pretty clear. 

MBS LUTESTRING. Have you time to come home with 
me and discuss the matter? 

THE ARCHBISHOP [rising] With pleasure. 

BARNABAS [rising also and rushing past Mrs Lute- 
string to the door, where he turns to bar her way] No 
you dont. Burge: you understand, dont you? 

BURGE-LUBIN. No. What is it? 

BARNABAS. These two are going to marry. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Why shouldnt they, if they want to? 

BARNABAS. They dont want to. They will doit in cold 
blood because their children will live three hundied years. 
Jt mustnt be allowed. 

conrucius. You cannot prevent it. There is no law 
that gives you power to interfere with them. 

BarNazas. If they force me to it I will obtain legis- 
lation against marriages above the age of seventy-eight. 

THE ARCHBISHOP. There is not time for that before 





The Thing Happens 145 


we are married, Mr Accountant General. Be good 
enough to get out of the lady’s way. 

BARNABAS. ‘There is time to send the lady to the 
lethal chamber before anything comes of your marriage. 
Dont forget that. 

MRS LUTESTRING. What nonsense, Mr Accountant 
General! Good afternoon, Mr President. Good after- 
noon, Mr Chief Secretary. [They rise and acknowledge 
her salutation with bows. She walks straight at the 
Accountant General, who instinctively shrinks out of her 
way as she leaves the room]. 

THE ARCHBIsHOP. I am surprised at you, Mr Barna- 
bas. Your tone was like an echo from the Dark Ages. 
[He follows the Domestic Minister]. 

Confucius, shaking his head and cluckmg with his 
tongue in deprecation of this painful episode, moves to 
the chair just vacated by the Archbishop and stands 
behind it with fiolded palms, looking at the President. 
The Accountant General shakes his fist after the de- 
parted visitors, and bursts into savage abuse of them. 

BARNABAS. Thieves! Cursed thieves! Vampires! 
What are you going to do, Burge? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Do? 

BABNABAS. Yes, do. There must be dozens of these 
people in existence. Are you going to let them do what 
the two who have just left us mean to do, and crowd us 
off the face of the earth? 

BURGE-LUBIN [sitting down] Oh, come, Barnabas! 
What harm are they doing? Arnt you interested in 
them? Dont you like them? 

BARNABAS. Like them! I hate them. They are mon- 
sters, unnatural monsters. They are poison to me. 

BURGE-LUBIN. What possible objection can there be 
to their living as long as they can? It does not shorten 
our lives, does it? 


146 The Thing Happens Part III 


BARNABAS. If I have to die when I am seventy-eight, 
I dont see why another man should be privileged to live 
to be two hundred and seventy-eight. It does shorten 
my life, relatively. It makes us ridiculous. If they 
grew to be twelve feet high they would make us all 
dwarfs. They talked to us as if we were children. There 
is no love lost between us: their hatred of us came out 
soon enough. You heard what the woman said, and how 
the Archbishop backed her up? 

BURGE-LUBIN. But what can we do to them? 

BARNABAS, Kill them. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Nonsense! 

BARNABAS, Lock them up. Sterilize them somehow, 
anyhow. 

BURGE-LUBIN. But what reason could we give? 

BARNABAS. What reason can you give for killing a 
snake? Nature tells you to do it. 

BURGE-LUBIN. My dear Barnabas, you are out of 
your mind. 

BARNABAS. Havnt you said that once too often al- 
ready this morning? 

BURGE-LUBIN. I dont believe you will carry a single 
soul with you. 

BARNABAS. I understand. I know you. You think 
you are one of them. 

conrucius. Mr Accountant General: you may be one 
of them. 

BARNABAS. How dare you accuse me of such a thing? 
I am an honest man, not a monster. I won my place in 
public life by demonstrating that the true expectation 
of human life is seventy-eight point six. And I will 
resist any attempt to alter or upset it to the last drop 
of my blood if need be. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Oh, tut tut! Come, come! Pull your- 
self together. How can you, a descendant of the great 


Part III The Thing Happens 147 


Conrad Barnabas, the man who is still remembered by 
his masterly Biography of a Black Beetle, be so absurd? 

BARNABAS, You had better go and write the autobi- 
ography of a jackass. I am going to raise the country 
against this horror, and against you, if you shew the 
slightest sign of weakness about it. 

conFucius [very impressively | You will regret it if 
you do. 

BARNABAS, What is to make me regret it? 

conFucius. Every mortal man and woman in the 
community will begin to count on living for three cen- 
turies. ‘Things will happen which you do not foresee: 
terrible things. The family will dissolve: parents and 
children will be no longer the old and the young: broth- 
ers and sisters will meet as strangers after a hundred 
years separation: the ties of blood will lose their inno- 
cence. The imaginations of men, let loose over the pos- 
sibilities of three centuries of life, will drive them mad 
and wreck human society. This discovery must be kept 
a dead secret. [He sits down.] 

parnapas. And if I refuse to keep the secret? 

conrucius. I shall have you safe in a lunatic asylum 
the day after you blab. 

BARNABAS. You forget that I can produce the Arch- 
bishop to prove my statement, 

conrucivs. So can I. Which of us do you think 
he will support when I explain to him that your object 
in revealing his age is to get him killed? | 

BARNABAS [desperate] Burge: are you going to back 
up this yellow abomination against me? Are we public 
men and members of the Government? or are we damned 
blackguards ? 

conrucius [unmoved] Have you ever known a public 
man who was not what vituperative people call a, damned 


148 The Thing Happens Part III 


blackguard when some inconsiderate person wanted to 
tell the public more than was good for it? 

BARNABAS. Hold your tongue, you insolent heathen. 
Burge: I spoke to you. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Well, you know, my dear Barnabas, 
Confucius is a very long-headed chap. I see his point. 

BARNABAS. Do you? Then let me tell you that, ex- 
cept officially, I will never speak to you again. Do you 
hear? 

BURGE-LUBIN [cheerfully] You will. You will. 

BARNABAS. And dont you ever dare speak to me again. 
Do you hear? [He turns to the door. | 

BURGE-LUBIN. I will. I will. Good-bye, Barnabas. 
God bless you. 

BARNABAS. May you live forever, and be the laugh- 
ing-stock of the whole world! [He dashes out in a 
fury]. 

BURGE-LUBIN [laughing indulgently | He will keep the 
secret all right. I know Barnabas. You neednt worry. 

conructus [troubled and grave | There are no secrets 
except the secrets that keep themselves. Consider. 
There are those films at the Record Office. We have no 
power to prevent the Master of the Records from pub- 
lishing this discovery made in his department. We can- 
not silence the American—who can silence an American? 
——nor the people who were there today to receive him. 
Fortunately, a film can prove nothing but a resemblance, 

BURGE-LUBIN. Thats very true. After all, the whole 
thing is confounded nonsense, isnt it? 

conFucius [raising his head to look at him] You 
have decided not to believe it now that you realize its in- 
conveniences. That is the English method. It may not 
work in this case. 

BURGE-LUBIN. English be hanged! It’s common 
sense. You know, those two people got us hypnotized: 


Part III The Thing Happens 149 


not a doubt of it. They must have been kidding us. 
They were, wernt they? 

conrucius. You looked into that woman’s face; and 
you believed. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Just so, Thats where she had me. I 
eet have believed her a bit if she’d turned her back 
oO me. 

conrucius [shakes his head slowly and repeat- 
edly| ? ? ? 

BURGE-LUBIN. You really think—? [He hesitates]. 

conFucius. The Archbishop has always been a puzzle 
to me. Ever since I learnt to distinguish between one 
English face and another I have noticed what the woman 
pointed out: that the English face is not an adult face, 
just as the English mind is not an adult mind. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Stow it, John Chinaman. If ever there 
was a race divinely appointed to take charge of the non- 
adult races and guide them’ and train them and keep 
them out of mischief until they grow up to be capable 
of adopting our institutions, that race 1s the English 
race. It is the only race in the world that has that char- 
acteristic. Now! 

conrucius. That is the fancy of a child nursing a 
doll. But it is ten times more childish of you to dis- 
pute the highest compliment ever paid you. 

BURGE-LUBIN. You call it a compliment to class us 
as grown-up children. 


conructus. Not grown-up children, children at fifty, 
sixty, seventy. Your maturity is so late that you never | 
attain to it. You have to be governed by races which | 


are mature at forty. ‘That means that you are poten- 
tially the most highly developed race on earth, and 
would be actually the greatest if you could live long 


enough to attain to maturity. 
BURCE-LUBIN [grasping the idea at last] By Georg® 


150 The Thing Happens Part III 


Confucius, youre right! I never thought of that. That 
explains everything. We are just a lot of schoolboys: 
theres no denying it. Talk to an Englishman about 
anything serious, and he listens to you curiously for a 
moment just as he listens to a chap playing classical 
music. ‘Then he goes back to his marine golf, or motor- 
ing, or flying, or women, just like a bit of stretched 
elastic when you let it go. [Soaring to the height of his 
theme]. Oh, youre quite right. We are only m our in- 
fancy. I ought to be in a perambulator, with a nurse 
shoving me along. It’s true: it’s absolutely true. But 
some day we'll grow up; and then, by Jingo, we'll 
shew em. 

conrucius. The Archbishop is an adult. When I 
was a child I was dominated and intimidated by people 
whom I now know to have been weaker and sillier than I, 
because there was some mysterious quality in their mere 
age that overawed me. I confess that, though I have 
kept up appearances, I have always been afraid of the 
Archbishop. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Between ourselves, Confucius, so 
have I. 

conFucius. It is this that convinced me. It was this 
in the woman’s face that convinced you. Their new de- 
parture in the history of the race is no fraud. It does 
not even surprise me. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Oh, come! Not surprise you! It’s 
your pose never to be surprised at anything; but if you 
are not surprised at this you are not human. 

conructus. I am staggered, just as a man may be 
staggered by an explosion for which he has himself laid 
the charge and lighted the fuse. But I am not sur- 
prised, because, as a philosopher and a student of evolu- 
tionary biology, I have come to regard some such devel- 
opment as this as mevitable. If I had not thus prepared 


Part III The Thing Happens 151 


myself to be eredulous, no mere evidence of films and 
well-told tales would have persuaded me to believe. As 
it 1s, I do believe. _ 
_ BURGE-LUBIN. Well, that being settled, what the devil 
is to happen next? Whats the next move for us? 
conFucius. We do not make the next move. The 
next move will be made hy the Archbishop and the 
woman. 

BARGE-LUBIN. Their marriage? 

conFucius. More than that. They have made the 
momentous discovery that they are not alone in the 
world. 

BURGE-LUBIN. You think there are others? 

conrucius. ‘There must be many others. Each of 
them believes that he or she is the only one to whom the 
miracle has happened. But the Archbishop knows better 
now. lHewill advertise in terms which only the longlived 
people will understand. He will bring them together and 
organize them. They will hasten from all parts of the 
earth. ‘They will become a great Power. 

BURGE-LUBIN [a little alarmed| I say, will they? I 
suppose they will. I wonder is Barnabas right after all? 
Ought we to allow it? 

conrucius. Nothing that we can do will stop it. We 
cannot in our souls really want to stop it: the vital force 
that has produced this change would paralyze our oppo- 
sition to it, if we were mad enough to oppose. But we 
will not oppose. You and I may be of the elect, too. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Yes: thats what gets us every time. 
What the deuce ought we to do? Something must be 
done about it, you know. 

conructus. Let us sit still, and meditate in silence 
on the vistas before us. : 

BURGE-LUBIN. By George, I believe youre right. 


Let us.

They sit meditating, the Chinaman naturally, the

THE NEGREsS. Mr President. 

BURGE-LUBIN | joyfully] Yes. [Taking up a peg.]| 
Are you at home? 

THE NEGREsS. No. Omega, zero, x squared. 

The President rapidly puts the peg m the switch- 
board; works the dial; and presses the button. The 
screen becomes transparent; and the Negress, brilliantly 
dressed, appears on what looks like the bridge of a steam 
yacht m glorious sea weather. The imstallation with 
which she is communicating its beside the binnacle. 

conrucivus [looking round, and recoiling with a shriek 
of disgust] Ach! Avaunt! Avaunt! [He rushes from the

BURGE-LUBIN. What part of the coast is that? 

THE NEGRESS. Fishguard Bay. Why not run over 
snd join me for the afternoon? I am disposed to be 
approachable at last. 

BURGE-LUBIN. But Fishguard! Two hundred and 
seventy miles! 

THE NEcEESS. There is a lightning express on the 
Irish Air Service at half-past sixteen. They will drop 
you by a parachute in the bay. The dip will do you 
good. I will pick you up and dry you and give you a 
first-rate time. 

BURGE-LUBIN. Delightful. But a little risky, isnt 
it?

nothing. | 

BURGE-LUBIN. I am not exactly afraid; but— 

THE NEGRESS [offended| But you think it is not good

out of her switchboard]. 

BURGE-LUBIN [imploringly] No: stop: let me explain: 
hold the line just one moment. Oh, please. 

THE NEGREsS [waiting with her hand poised over the 
peg | Well? 

BURGE-LUBIN. The fact is, I have been behaving very 
recklessly for some time past under the impression that 
my life would be so short that it was not worth bother- 
ing about. But I have just learnt that I may live— 
well, much longer than I expected. J am sure your 
good sense will tell you that this alters the case. I— 

THE NEGEESS [with suppressed rage | Oh, quite. Pray 
dont risk your precious life on my account. Sorry for

BURGE-LUBIN [urgently] No: please hold on. I can

Who is she calling up now? [He presses the button and 
calls] The Chief Secretary. Say I want to see him 
again, just for a moment. 

conFrucius’s voice. Is the woman gone? 

BURGE-LUBIN. Yes, yes: it’s all right. Just a 
moment if—[Confucius returns] Confucius: I have 
some important business at Fishguard. The Irish Air 
Service can drop me in the bay by parachute. I suppose 
it’s quite safe, isnt it? | 

conrucius. Nothing is quite safe. The air service 
is as safe as any other travelling service. The para- 
chute is safe. But the water is not safe, 

BURGE-LUBIN. Why? They will give me an unsink- 
able tunic, wont they?

BURGE-LUBIN. For life! That settles it: I wont

conrucius. Good. You have at last become 
prudent: you are no longer what you call a sportsman: 
you are a sensible coward, almost a grown-up man. I 
congratulate you. 

BURGE-LUBIN [resolutely] Coward or no coward, I 
will not face an eternity of rheumatism for any woman 
that ever was born. [He rises and goes to the rack for 
his fillet]. I have changed my mind; I am going home.

AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

TRAGEDY OF 
AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN 


ACT I 


Burrin pier on the south shore of Galway Bay in 
Ireland, a region of stone-capped hills and granite fields. 
It ts a fine summer day in the year 3000 a.v. On an 
ancient stone stump, about three feet thick and three 
feet high, used for securing ships by ropes to the shore, 
and called a bollard or holdfast, an elderly gentleman 
sits facing the land, with his head bowed and his face in 
hts hands, sobbing. His sunburnt skin contrasts with 
his white whiskers and eyebrows. He wears a black 
frock-coat, a white waistcoat, lavender trousers, a bril- 
liant silk cravat with a jewelled pin stuck in tt, a tall hat 
of grey felt, and patent leather boots with white spats. 
His starched linen cuffs protrude from his coat sleeves; 
and his collar, also of starched white linen, is Glad- 
stonian. On his right, three or four full sacks, lying 
side by side on the flags, suggest that the pier, unlike 
many remote Irish piers, is occasionally useful as well as 
romantic. On his left, behind him, a flight of stone steps 
descends out of sight to the sea level. 

A woman with a silk tunic and sandals, wearmg little 
else except a cap with the number 2 on it m gold, comes 
up the steps from the sea, and stares m astonishment at 
the sobbing man. Her age cannot be guessed: her face 
is firm and chiselled like a young face; but her expres- 
sion is unyouthful in its severity and determination. 

THE woman. What is the matter?

158 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


The elderly gentleman looks up; hastily pulls him. 
self together; takes out a silk handkerchief and dries his 
tears lightly with a brave attempt to smile through 
them; and tries ta rise gallantly, but sinks back]. 

THE WOMAN. Do you need assistance? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. No. Thank you very 
much. No. Nothing. The heat. [He punctuates 
with sniffs, and dabs with hts handkerchief at his eyes 
and nose|. Hay fever. 

THE WOMAN. You are a foreigner, are you not? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. No. You must not re- 
gard me as a foreigner. I am a Briton. 

THE WOMAN. You come from some part of the 
British Commonwealth? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [amiably pompous] From 
its capital, madam. 

THE WoMAN. From Baghdad? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Yes. You may not be 
aware, madam, that these islands were once the centre 
of the British Commonwealth, during a period now 
known as The Exile. They were its headquarters a 
thousand years ago. Few people know this interesting 
circumstance now; but I assure you it is true. J have 
come here on a pious pilgrimage to one of the numerous 
lands of my fathers. We are of the same stock, you 
and I. Blood is thicker than water. We are cousins. 

THE woman. I do not understand. You say you 
have come here on a pious pilgrimage. Is that some 
new means of transport? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [again shewing signs of 
distress] I find it very difficult to make myself under- 
stood here. I was not referring to a machine, but to a— 
a—a sentimental journey. 

THE WOMAN. I am afraid I am as much in the dark 


ActI ‘Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 159 


as before. You said also that blood is thicker thaw 
water. No doubt it is; but what of it? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Its meaning is obvious. 

THE woman. Perfectly. But I assure you I am 
quite aware that blood is thicker than water. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [ sniffing: almost in tears 
again] We will leave it at that, madam. 

THE woman [going nearer to him and scrutinizing 
him with some concern] I am afraid you are not well. 
Were you not warned that it is dangerous for shortlived 
people to come to this country? There is a deadly 
disease called discouragement, against which shortlived 
people have to take very strict precautions. Intercourse 
with us puts too great a strain on them. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [pulling himself together 
huffily] It has no effect on me, madam. I fear my con- 
versation does not interest you. If not, the remedy is in 
your own hands. 

THE woman [looking at her hands, and then looking 
inquiringly at him] Where? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [breaking down] Oh, this 
is dreadful. No understanding, no intelligence, no sym- 
pathy—[his sobs choke him]. 

THE WOMAN. You see, you are ill. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [nerved by indignation] I 
am not ill. I have never had a day’s illness in my life. 

THE woMAN. May I advise you? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I have no need of a lady 
doctor, thank you, madam. 

THE woman [shaking her head] I am afraid I do not 
understand. I said nothing about a butterfly. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Well, J said nothing 
about a butterfly. | 

THE woman. You spoke of alady doctor. The word 
is known here only as the name of a butterfly. 


160 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [insanely] I give up. I 
can bear this no longer. It is easier to go out of my 
mind at once. [He rises and dances about, singing]. 


I'd be a butterfly, born in a bower, 
Making apple dumplings without any flour. 


THE woman [smiling gravely] It must be at least a 
hundred and fifty years since I last laughed. But if you 
do that any more I shall certainly break out like a 
primary of sixty. Your dress is so extraordinarily 
ridiculous, 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [halting abruptly in his 
antics] My dress ridiculous! I may not be dressed like a 
Foreign Office clerk; but my clothes are perfectly in 
fashion in my native metropolis, where yours—pardon 
my saying’ so—would be considered extremely unusual 
and hardly decent. 

THE woman. Decent? There is no such word in our 
language. What does it mean? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. It would not be decent 
for me to explain. Decency cannot be discussed without 
indecency. 

THE woman. I cannot understand you at all. I fear 
you have not been observing the rules laid down for 
shortlived visitors. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Surely, madam, they do 
not apply to persons of my age and standing. IJ am 
not a child, nor an agricultural laborer. : 

THE woman [severely] They apply to you very 
strictly. You are expected to confine yourself to the 
society of children under sixty. You are absolutely for- 
bidden to approach fully adult natives under any cir- 
sumstances. You cannot converse with persons of my 
age for long without bringing on a dangerous attack of 
discouragement. Do you realize that you are already 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 161 


shewing grave symptoms of that very distressing and 
usually fatal complaint? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Certainly not, madam. I 
am fortunately in no danger of contracting it. I am 
quite accustomed to converse intimately and at the 
greatest length with the most distinguished persons. If 
you cannot discriminate between hay fever and imbe- 
cility, I can only say that your advanced years carry 
with them the inevitable penalty of dotage. 

THE WOMAN. I am one of the guardians of this dis- 
trict ; and I am responsible for your welfare— 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. ‘The Guardians! Do you 
take me for a pauper? 

THE woman. I do not know what a pauper is. You 
must tell me who you are, if it is possible for you to 
express yourself intelligibly— 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [snorts indignantly]! 

THE woman [continuing]|—and why are wandering 
here alone without a nurse. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [outraged] Nurse! 

THE woman. Shortlived visitors are not allowed to 
go about here without nurses. Do you not know that 
rules are meant to be kept? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. By the lower classes, no 
doubt. But to persons in my position there are certain 
courtesies which are never denied by well-bred people; 
and— 

THE woMAN. There are only two human classes 
here: the shortlived and the normal. The rules apply to 
the shortlived, and are for their own protection. Now 
tell me at once who you are. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [impressively] Madan, I 
am a retired gentleman, formerly Chairman of the All- 
British Synthetic Egg and Vegetable Cheese Trust in 
Baghdad, and now President of the British Historical 


162 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman PartIV 


and Archeological Society, and a Vice-President of the 
Travellers’ Club. 

THE woman. All that does not matter. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [again snorting] Hm! 
Indeed! 

THE woman. Have you been sent here to make your 
mind flexible? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. What an extraordinary 
question! Pray do you find my mind noticeably stiffr 

THE woman. Perhaps you do not know that you are 
on the west coast of Ireland, and that it is the practice 
among natives of the Eastern Island to spend some years 
here to acquire mental flexibility. The climate has that 
effect. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [haughtily] I was born, 
not in Eastern Island, but, thank God, in dear old 
British Baghdad; and I am not in need of a mental 
health resort. 

THE woman. Then why are you here? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Am I trespassing?. I 
was not aware of it. 

THE WOMAN. ‘Trespassing? I do not understand the 
word. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Is this land private 
property. If so, I make no claim. I proffer a shilling 
in satisfaction of damage (if any), and am ready to 
withdraw if you will be good enough to shew me the 
nearest way. [He offers her a shilling. 

THE woman [taking it and examining tt without much 
interest | I do not understand a single word of what you 
have just said. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I am speaking the plain- 
est English. Are you the landlord? 

THE womMaN [shaking her head] There is a tradition 
in this part of the country of an animal with a name like 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 163 


that. It used to be hunted and shot in the barbarous 
ages. It is quite extinct now. 

_ THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [breaking down again] It 
is a dreadful thing to be in a country where nobody 
understands civilized institutions. [He collapses on the 
bollard, struggling with his rising sobs]. Excuse me. 
Hay fever. 

THE woman [taking a tuning-fork from her girdle 
and holding it to her ear; then speaking into space on 
one note, like a chorister intoning a psalm| Burrin Pier 
Galway please send someone to take charge of a dis- 
couraged shortliver who has escaped from his nurse male 
harmless babbles unintelligibly with moments of sense 
distressed hysterical foreign dress very funny has 
curious fringe of white sea-weed under his chin. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. This is a gross imperti- 
nence. An insult. 

THE woman [replacing her tuning-fork and addressx 
ing the elderly gentleman] ‘These words mean nothing to 
me. In what capacity are you here? How did you 
obtain permission to visit us? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [importantly] Our Prime 
Minister, Mr Badger Bluebin, has come to consult the 
oracle. He is my son-in-law. We are accompanied by 
his wife and daughter: my daughter and granddaughter. 
I may mention that General Aufsteig, who is one of our 
party, is really the Emperor of Turania travelling in- 
cognito. I understand he has a question to put to the 
oracle informally. I have come solely to visit the 


country. 
THE woman. Why should you come to a place where 


you have no business? 
THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Great Heavens, madam, 


can anything be more natural? I shall be the only 


164 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


member of the Travellers’ Club who has set foot on these 
shores. Think of that! My position will be unique. 

THe woman. Is that an advantage? We have a 
person here who has lost both legs in an accident. His 
position is unique. But he would much rather be like 
everyone else. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. This is maddening. 
There is no analogy whatever between the two cases. 

THE woMAN. ‘They are both unique. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Conversation in this 
place seems to consist of ridiculous quibbles. I am 
heartily tired of them. 

THE woMAN. I conclude that your Travellers’ Club 
is an assembly of persons who wish to be able to say that 
they have been in some place where nobody else has been. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Of course if you wish to 
sneer at us—— 

THE womaN. What is sneer? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [with a wild sob| I shall 
drown myself. 

He makes desperately for the edge of the pier, but is 
confronted by a man with the number one on his cap, 
who comes up the steps and intercepts him. He is 
dressed like the woman; but a slight moustache pro- 
claims his sex. 

THE MAN | to the elderly gentleman] Ah, here you are. 
I shall really have to put a collar and lead on you if you 
persist in giving me the slip like this. 

THE WOMAN. Are you this stranger’s nurse? 

THE MAN. Yes. I am very tired of him. If I take 
my eyes off him for a moment, he runs away and talks 
to everybody. 

THE woman [after taking out her tuning-fork and 
sounding tt, intones as before] Burrin Pier. Wash out. 
[She puts up the fork, and addresses the man]. J sent 


Act I Tragety ‘lL Elderly Gentleman 165 


a call for somegne to take care of him. I have been try- 
ing to talk to Aim; but I can understand very little of 
what he says. You must take better care of him: he is 
badly discouraged already. If I can be of any further 
use, Fusima, Go#t, will find me. [She goes away]. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Any further use! She 
has been of no use to me. She spoke to me without any 
introduction, like any improper female. And she has 
made off with nry shilling. 

THE MAN. Please jspeak slowly: I cannot follow. 
What is a shilling?*)jWhat is an introduction? Im- 
proper female doesnt make sense. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Nothing seems to make 
sense here. All I can tell you is that she was the most 
impenetrably stupid woman I have ever met in the whole 
course of my life. 

THE MAN. That cannot be. She cannot appear 
stupid to you. She is a secondary, and getting on for a 
tertiary at that. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. What is a tertiary? 
Everybody here keeps talking to me about primaries 
and secondaries and tertiaries as if people were geo- 
logical strata. 

THE MaN. The primaries are in their first century. 
The secondaries are in their second century. I am stil! 
classed as a primary [he points to his number |; but I 
may almost call myself a secondary, and I shall be 
ninety-five next January. The tertiaries are in their 
third century. Did you not see the number two on her 
badge? She is an advanced secondary. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. ‘That accounts for it. 
She is in her second childhood. 

rie MaN. Her second childhood! She is in her fifth 
childhood. 


THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [again resorting to the 


166 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 
bollard] Oh! I cannot bear the 
ments. 4 

THE MAN [impatient and helpless] Yow shouldnt have 
come among us. This is no placejfor Pep. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [néPved. by indignation] 
May I ask why? I am a View Hien of the 
Travellers’ Club. I have been everywhere: I hold the 
record in the Club for civilized cottytries. 

THE MAN. What is a civilized pa 4 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. is-ewell, it is a 
civilized country. [Desperately dent know: I—I— 
I—JI shall go mad if you keep ont asking me to tell you 
these things that everybody knews. “Countries where 
you can travel comfortably. Where there are good 
hotels. Excuse me; but, though you say you are ninety- 
four, you are worse company than a child of five with 
your eternal questions. Why not call me Daddy at 
once? 

THE MAN. I did not know your name was Daddy. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. My name is Joseph Pop- 
ham Bolge Bluebin Barlow, O.M. 

THE MAN. That is five men’s names. Daddy is 
shorter. And O.M. will not do here. It is our name for 
certain wild creatures, descendants of the aboriginal in- 
habitants of this coast. ‘They used to be called the 
O’Mulligans. We will stick to Daddy. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. People will think I am 
your father. 

THE MAN [shocked] Sh-sh! People here never allude 
to such relationships. It is not quite delicate, is it? 
What does it matter whether you are my father or not? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. My worthy nonagenarian 
friend: your faculties are totally decayed. Could you 
not find me a guide of my own age? 

SHE MAN. A young person? 







unpatural arrange-

ActI ‘Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 167 


THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Certainly not. I cannot 
go about with a young person. 

THE MAN. Why? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Why! Why!! Why!!! 
Have you no moral sense? 

THE MAN. [ shall have to give you up. I cannot 
understand you. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. But you meant a young 
woman, diant you? 

THE MAN. I meant simply somebody of your own 
age. What difference does it make whether the person 
is a man or a woman? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I could not have believed 
in the existence of such scandalous insensibility to the 
elementary decencies of human intercourse. 

THE MAN. What are decencies? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [shrieking] Everyone asks 
me that. 

THE MAN [taking out a tuning-fork and using tt as 
the woman did| Zozim on Burrin Pier to Zoo Ennisty- 
mon I have found the discouraged shortliver he has been 
talking to a secondary and is much worse I am too old he 
is asking for someone of his own age or younger come if 
youcan. [He puts up his fork and turns to the Elderly 
Gentleman]. Zoo is a girl of fifty, and rather childish 
at that. So perhaps she may make you happy. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Make me happy! A 
bluestocking of fifty! Thank you. 

THE MAN. Bluestocking? The effort to make out 
your meaning is fatiguing. Besides, you are talking 
too much to me: I am old enough to discourage you. Let 
us be silent until Zoo comes. [He turns his back on the 
Elderly Gentleman, and sits down on the edge of the 
pier, with his legs dangling over the water |. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Certainly. I have no 


i 
& 


168 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


wish to force my conversation on any man who does not 
desire it. Perhaps you would like to take a nap. If so, 
pray do not stand on ceremony. 

THE MAN. What is a nap? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [exasperated, going to him 
and speaking with great precision and distinctness] A 
nap, my friend, is a brief period of sleep which over- 
takes superannuated persons when they endeavor to 
entertain unwelcome visitors or to listen to scientific lec- 
tures. Sleep. Sleep. [Bazwling into his ear] Sleep. 

THE MAN. I tell you I am nearly a secondary. I 
never sleep. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [awestruck] Good 
Heavens! 

A young woman with the number one on her cap 
arrives by land. She looks no older than Savoy Bar- 
nabas, whom she somewhat resembles, looked a thousand 
years before. Younger, if anything. 

THE YOUNG woman. Is this the patient? 

THE MAN [scrambling up| This is Zoo. [T'o Zoo]. 
Call him Daddy. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [vehemently] No. 

THE MAN [ignoring the interruption] Bless you for 
taking him off my hands! I have had as much of him as 
Icanbear. [He goes down the steps and disappears. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [tronically taking off his 
hat and making a sweeping bow from the edge of the 
pier in the direction of the Atlantic Ocean] Good after- 
noon, sir; and thank you very much for your extraordi- 
nary politeness, your exquisite consideration for my 
feelings, your courtly manners. Thank you from the 
bottom of my heart. [Clapping his hat on again] Pig! 
Ass! 

zoo [laughs very heartily at him]!!! 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [turning sharply on her] 


ActI ‘Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 169 


Good afternoon, madam. I am sorry to have had to put 
your fnend in his place; but I find that here as else- 
where it is necessary to assert myself if I am to be 
treated with proper consideration. I had hoped that my 
position as a guest would protect me from insult. 

zoo. Putting my friend in his place. That is some 
poetic expression, is it not? What does it mean? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Pray, is there no one in 
these islands who understands plain English? 

zoo. Well, nobody except the oracles. They have to 
make a special] historical study of what we call the dead 
thought. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Dead thought! I have 
heard of the dead languages, but never of the dead 
thought. 

zoo. Well, thoughts die sooner than languages. I 
understand your language; but I do not always under- 
stand your thought. The oracles will understand you 
perfectly. Have you had your consultation yet? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I did not come to con- 
sult the oracle, madam. I am here simply as a gentle- 
man travelling for pleasure m the company of my 
daughter, who is the wife of the British Prime Minister, 
and of General Aufsteig, who, I may tell you in confi- 
dence, is really the Emperor of Turania, the greatest 
military genius of the age. 

zoo. Why should you travel for pleasure! Can you 
not enjoy yourself at home? 

na ieeaae GENTLEMAN. I wish to see the world. 

zoo. Itistoobig. You can see a bit of it anywhere. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [out of patience | Damn it, 
madam, you dont want to spend your life looking at the 
same bit of it! [Checking himself] I beg your pardon 

wearing in your presence. 
Uae OF! That 2 swearing, is it? I have reag 


170 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman PartIV 


about that. It sounds quite pretty. Dammitmaddam, 
dammitmaddam, dammitmaddan, dammitmaddam. Say 
it as often as you p‘ease: I like it. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [expanding with intense 
relief] Bless you for those profane but familiar words! 
Thank you, thank you. For the first time since I landed 
in this terrible country I begin to feel at home. The 
strain which was driving me mad relaxes: I feel almost 
as if I were at the club. Excuse my taking the only 
available seat: I am not so young as I was. [He sits on 
the bollard|]. Promise me that you will not hand me 
over to one of these dreadful tertiaries or secondaries or 
whatever you call them. 

zoo. Never fear. They had no business to give you 
in charge to Zozim. You see he is just on the verge of 
becoming a secondary; and these adolescents will give 
themselves the airs of tertiaries. You naturally feel 
more at home with a flapper like me. [She makes her- 
self comfortable on the sacks}. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Flapper? What does 
that mean? 

zoo. It is an archaic word which we still use to 
describe a female who is no lofger a girl and is not yet 
quite adult. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. A very agreeable age to 
associate with, I find. I am recovering rapidly. I have 
a sense of blossoming like a flower. May I ask your 
name? 

zoo. Zoo. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Miss Zoo. 

zoo. Not Miss Zoo. Zoo. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Precisely. Er—Zoo 
what? 

zoo. No. Not Zoo What. Zoo. Nothing but Zoo. 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 171 


THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [puzzled] Mrs Zoo, 
perhaps. 

zoo. No. Zoo. Cant you catch it? Zoo. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Of course. Believe me, I 
did not really think you were married: you are obviously 
too young; but here it is so hard to feel sure—er— 

200 [hopelessly puzzled | What? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Marriage makes a dif- 
ference, you know. One can say things to a married 
lady that would perhaps be in questionable taste to any- 
one without that experience. 

zoo. You are getting out of my depth: I dont under- 
stand a word you are saying. Married and questionable 
taste convey nothing to me. Stop, though. Is married 
an old form of the word mothered? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Very likely. Let us drop 
the subject. Pardon me for embarrassing you. I 
should not have mentioned it. 

zoo. What does embarrassing mean? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Well, really! I should 
have thought that so natural and common a condition 
would be understood as long as human nature lasted. To 
embarrass is to bring a blush to the cheek. 

zoo. What is a blush? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [amazed] Dont you 
blush? ? ? 

zoo. Never heard of it. We have a word flush, 
meaning a rush of blood to the skin. I have noticed it 
in my babies, but not after the age of two. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Your babies!!! I fear 
I am treading on very delicate ground ; but your appear- 
ance is extremely youthful; and if I may ask how 
many—? 

zoo. Only four as yet. It is a long business with 


72 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


s. I specialize in babies. My first was such a success 
hat they made me goon. I— 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [reeling on the bollard] 
Yh dear! 

zoo. Whats the matter? Anything wrong? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. In MHeaven’s name, 
yadam, how old are you? 

zoo. Fifty-six. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. My knees are trembling. 

fear I am really ill. Not so young as I was. 

zoo. I noticed that you are not strong on your legs 
et. You have many of the ways and weaknesses of a 
aby. No doubt that is why I feel called on to mother 
‘ou. You certainly are avery silly little Daddy. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [stimulated by indigna- 
ion] My name, I repeat, is Joseph Popham Bolge Blue- 
in Barlow, O.M. 

zoo. What a ridiculously long name! I cant call 
ou all that. What did your mother call you? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. You recall the bitterest 
truggles of my childhood. I was sensitive on the point. 
vhildren suffer greatly from absurd nicknames. My 
1other thonghtlessly called me Iddy Toodles. I was 
alled Iddy until I went to school, when I made my first 
tand for children’s rights by insisting on being called 
t least Joe. At fifteen I refused to answer to anything 
horter than Joseph. At eighteen I discovered that the 
ame Joseph was supposed to indicate an unmanly 
rudery because of some old story about a Joseph who 
ejected the advances of his employer’s wife: very 
roperly in my opinion. I then became Popham to my 
amily and intimate friends, and Mister Barlow to the 
est of the world. My mother slipped back to Iddy 
rhen her faculties began to fail her, poor woman; but I 
ould not resent that, at her age. 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 173 


zoo. Do you mean to say that your mother bothered 
about you after you were ten? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Naturally, madam. She 
was my mother. What would you have had her do? 

_Z00. Go on to the next, of course. After eight or 
nine children become quite uninteresting, except to 
themselves. I shouldnt know my two eldest if I met 
them. 

_ THE ELDERLY GENTLEMEN [again drooping] I am 
dymg. Let me die. I wish to die. 

zoo | going to him quickly and supporting him] Hold 
up. Sit up straight. Whats the matter? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [faintly] My spine, I 
think, Shock. Concussion. ila i te 

zoo [maternally] Pow wow wow! What is there to 
shock you? [Shaking him playfully]. There! Sit up; 
and. be good. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [still feebly|] Thank you. 
I am better now. 

zoo [resuming her seat on the sacks| But what was 
all the rest of that long name for? There was a lot 
more of it. Blops Booby or something. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [impressively | Bolge Blue- 
bin, madam: a historical name. Let me inform you that 
I can trace my family back for more than a thousand 
years, from the Eastern Empire to its ancient seat in 
these islands, to a time when two of my ancestors, Joyce 
Bolge and Hengist Horsa Bluebin, wrestled with one 
another for the prime ministership of the British Em- 
pire, and occupied that position successively with a 
glory of which we can in these degenerate days form but 
a faint conception. When I think of these mighty men, 
lions in war, sages in peace, not babblers and charlatans 
like the pigmies who now occupy their places in Bagh- 
dad, but strong silent men, ruling an empire on which 


174 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


the sun never set, my eyes fill with tears: my heart 
bursts with emotion: I feel that to have lived but to the 
dawn of manhood in their day, and then died for them, 
would have been a nobler and happier lot than the 1gno- 
minious ease of my present longevity. 

zoo. Longevity! [She laughs]. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Yes, madam, relative 
longevity. As it is, I have to be content and proud to 
know that I am descended from both those heroes. 

zoo. You must be descended from every Briton who 
was alive in their time. Dont you know that? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Do not quibble, madam. 
I bear their names, Bolge and Bluebin; and I hope I 
have inherited something of their majestic spirit. Well, 
they were born in these islands. I repeat, these islands 
were then, incredible as it now seems, the centre of the 
British Empire. When that centre shifted to Baghdad, 
and the Englishman at last returned to the true cradle 
of his race in Mesopotamia, the western islands were 
cast off, as they had been before by the Roman Empire. 
But it was to the British race, and in these islands, that 
the greatest miracle in history occurred. 

zoo. Miracle? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Yes: the first man to live 
three hundred years was an Englishman. The first, that 
is, since the contemporaries of Methuselah. 

zoo. Oh, that! 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Yes, that, as you call it 
60 flippantly. Are you aware, madam, that at that 
immortal moment the English race had lost intellectual] 
credit to such an extent that they habitually spoke of 
one another as fatheads? Yet England is now a sacred 
grove to which statesmen from all over the earth come to 
consult English sages who speak with the experience of 
two and a half centuries of life. The land that once 


ActI ‘Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 175 


exported cotton shirts and hardware now exports 
nothing but wisdom. You see before you, madam, a 
man utterly weary of the week-end riverside hotels of 
the Euphrates, the minstrels and pierrots on the sands 
of the Persian Gulf, the toboggans and funiculars of 
the Hindoo Koosh. Can you wonder that I turn, with 
a hungry heart, to the mystery and beauty of these 
haunted islands, thronged with spectres from a magic 
past, made holy by the footsteps of the wise men of 
the West. Consider this island on which we stand, the 
last foothold of man on this side of the Atlantic: this 
Ireland, described by the earliest bards as an emerald 
gem set in a silver sea! Can I, a scion of the illustrious 
British race, ever forget that when the Empire trans- 
ferred its seat to the East, and said to the turbulent Irish 
race which 1t had oppressed but never conquered, “At 
last we leave you to yourselves; and much good may it 
do you,” the Irish as one man uttered the historic shout 
“No: we'll be damned if you do,” and emigrated to the 
countries where there was still a Nationalist question, to 
India, Persia, and Corea, to Morocco, ‘Tunis, and 
Tripoli. In these countries they were ever foremost in 
the struggle for national independence; and the world 
rang continually with the story of their sufferings and 
wrongs. And what poem can do justice to the end, when 
it came at last? Hardly two hundred years had elapsed 
when the claims of nationality were so universally con- 
ceded that there was no longer a single country on the 
face of the earth with a national grievance or a national 
movement. Think of the position of the Irish, who had 
lost all their political faculties by disuse except that of 
nationalist agitation, and who owed their position as 
the most interesting race on earth solely to their suffer- 
ings! The very countries they had helped to set free 
boycotted them as intolerable bores. The communities 


176 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


which had once idolized them as the incarnation of all 
that is adorable in the warm heart and witty brain, fled 
from them as from a pestilence. To regain their lost 
prestige, the Irish claimed the city of Jerusalem, on the 
ground that they were the lost tribes of Israel; but on 
their approach the Jews abandoned the city and redis- 
tributed themselves throughout Europe. It was then 
that these devoted Irishmen, not one of whom had ever 
seen Ireland, were counselled by an English Archbishop, 
the father of the oracles, to go back to their own coun- 
try. This had never once occurred to them, because 
there was nothing to prevent them and nobody to forbid 
them. They jumped at the suggestion. ‘They landed 
here: here in Galway Bay, on this very ground. When 
they reached the shore the older men and women flung 
themselves down and passionately kissed the soil of Ire- 
land, calling on the young to embrace the earth that 
had borne their ancestors. But the young looked 
gloomily on, and said ‘““There is no earth, only stone.” 
You will see by looking round you why they said that: 
the fields here are of stone: the hills are capped with 
granite. They all left for England next day; and no 
Irishman ever again confessed of being Irish, even to 
his own children; so that when that generation passed 
away the Irish race vanished from human knowledge. 
And the dispersed Jews did the same lest they should 
be sent back to Palestine. Since then the world, bereft 
of its Jews and its Irish, has been a tame dull place. Is 
there no pathos for you in this story? Can you not 
understand now why I am come to visit the scene of this 
tragic effacement of a race of heroes and poets? 

zoo. We still tell our little children stories like that, 
to help them to understand. But such things do not 
happen really. That scene of the Irish landing here and 
kissing the ground might have happened to a hundred 


ActI ‘Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 177 


people. It couldnt have happened to a hundred thou- 
sand: you know that as wellas I do. And what a ridicu- 
lous thing to call people Irish because they live in Ire- 
Jand! you might as well call them Airish because they 
live in air. They must be just the same as other people. 
Why do you shortlivers persist in making up silly stories 
about the world and trymg to act as if they were true? 
Contact with truth hurts and frightens you: you escape 
from it into an imaginary vacuum in which you can in- 
dulge your desires and hopes and loves and hates with- 
out any obstruction from the solid facts of life. You 
love to throw dust in your own eyes. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. It is my turn now, 
madam, to inform you that I do not understand a single 
word you are saying. I should have thought that the 
use of a vacuum for removing dust was a mark of civili- 
gation rather than of savagery. 

zoo [giving him up as hopeless] Oh, Daddy, Daddy: 
I can hardly believe that you are human, you are so 
stupid. It was well said of your people in the olden 
days, “Dust thou art; and to dust thou shalt return.” 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [nobly] My body is dust, 
madam: not my soul. What does it matter what my 
body is made of? the dust of the ground, the particles 
of the air, or even the slime of the ditch? ‘The import- 
ant thing is that when my Creator took it, whatever it 
was, He breathed into its nostrils the breath of life; and 
Man became a living soul. Yes, madam, a living soul. 
I am not the dust of the ground: I am a living soul. 
That is an exalting, a magnificent thought. It is also 
a great scientific fact. I am not interested in the chem- 
scals and the microbes: I leave them to the chumps and 
noodles, to the blockheads and the muckrakers who are 
incapable of their own glorious destiny, and unconscious 
of their own divinity. They tell me there are leucocytes 


178 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


in my blood, and sodium and carbon in my flesh. I thank 
them for the information, and tell them that there are 
blackbeetles in my kitchen, washing soda in my laundry, 
and coal in my cellar. I do not deny their existence; but 
I keep them in their proper place, which is not, if I may 
be allowed to use an antiquated form of expression, the 
temple of the Holy Ghost. No doubt you think me be- 
hind the times ; but I rejoice in my enlightenment ; and I 
recoil from your ignorance, your blindness, your imbe- 
cility. Humanly I pity you. Intellectually I despise 
you. 

zoo. Bravo, Daddy! You have the root of the matter 
in you. You will not die of discouragement after all. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I have not the smallest in- 
tention of domg so, madam. I am no longer young; 
and I have moments of weakness; but when I approach 
this subject the divine spark in me kindles and glows, 
the corruptible becomes incorruptible, and the mortal 
Bolge Bluebin Barlow puts on immortality. On this 
ground I am your equal, even if you survive me by ten 
thousand years. 

zoo. Yes; but what do we know about this breath of 
life that puffs you up so exaltedly? Just nothing. So 
let us shake hands as cultivated Agnostics, and change 
the subject. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Cultivated fiddlesticks, 
madam! You cannot change this subject until the 
heavens and the earth pass away. I am not an Agnostic: 
Tama gentleman. When I believe a thing I say I believe 
it: when I dont believe it I say I dont believe it. I do 
not shirk my responsibilities by pretending that I know 
nothing and therefore can believe nothing. We cannot 
disclaim knowledge and shirk responsibility. We must 
proceed on assumptions of some sort or we cannot form 
a human society. 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 179 


z00. ‘he assumptions must be scientific, Daddy. We 
must live by science in the long run. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. | have the utmost respect, 
madam, for the magnificent discoveries which we owe to 
science. But any fool canmake adiscovery. Every baby 
has to discover more in the first years of its life than 
Roger Bacon ever discovered in his laboratory. When I 
was seven years old I discovered the sting of the wasp. 
But I do not ask you to worship me on that account. [ 
assure you, madam, the merest mediocrities can discover 
the most surprising facts about the physical universe as 
soon as they are civilized enough to have time to study 
these things, and to invent instruments and apparatus 
for research. But what is the consequence? ‘Their dis- 
coveries discredit the simple stories of our religion. At 
first we had no idea of astronomical space. We believed 
the sky to be only the ceiling of a room as large as the 
earth, with another rocm on top of it. Death was to us 
a going upstairs into that room, or, if we did not obey 
the priests, going downstairs into the coal cellar. We 
founded our religion, our morality, our laws, our lessons, 
our poems, our prayers, on that simple belief. Well, 
the moment men became astronomers and made tele- 
scopes, their belief perished. When they could no longer 
believe in the sky, they found that they could no longer 
believe in their Deity, because they had always thought 
of him as living in the sky. When the priests themselves 
ceased to believe in their Deity and began to believe in 
astronomy, they changed their name and their dress, and 
called themselves doctors and men of science. They set 
up a new religion in which there was no Deity, but only 
wonders and miracles, with scientific instruments and 
apparatus as the wonder workers. Instead of worship- 
ping the greatness and wisdom of the Deity, men gaped 
foolishly at the million billion miles of space and wor- 


180 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


shipped the astronomer as infallible and omniscient. 
They built temples for his telescopes. Then they looked 
into their own bodies with microscopes, and found there, 
not the soul they had formerly believed in, but millions 
of micro-organisms; so they gaped at these as foolishly 
as at the millions of miles, and built microscope temples 
in which horrible sacrifices were offered. They even gave 
their own bodies to be sacrificed by the microscope man, 
who was worshipped, like the astronomer, as infallible 
and omniscient. ‘Thus our discoveries, instead of in- 
creasing our wisdom, only destroyed the little childish 
wisdom we had. All I can grant you is that they in- 
creased our knowledge. 

zoo. Nonsense! Consciousness of a fact is not knowl- 
edge of it: if it were, the fish would know more of the 
sea than the geographers and the naturalists. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. That is an extremely 
acute remark, madam. The dullest fish could not pos- 
sibly know less of the majesty of the ocean than many 
geographers and naturalists of my acquaintance. 

zoo. Just so, And the greatest fool on earth, by 
merely looking at a mariners’ compass, may become con- 
scious of the fact that the needle turns always to the 
pole. Is he any the less a fool with the consciousness 
than he was without it? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Only a more conceited 
one, madam, no doubt. Still, I do not quite see how you 
can be aware of the existence of a thing without know- 
ing it. 

zoo. Well, you can see a man without knowing him, 
can you not? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [illuminated] Oh how true! 
Of course, of course. There is a member of the Travel- 
lers’ Club who has questioned the veracity of an experi- 
ence of mine at the South Pole. I see that man almost 


Act I Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 181 


ed day when I am at home. But I refuse to know 
m. 

zoo. If you could see him much more distinctly 
through a magnifying glass, or examine a drop of his 
blood through a microscope, or dissect out all the organs 
and analyze them chemically, would you know him then? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Certainly not. Any such 
investigation could only increase the disgust with which 
he inspires me, and make me more determined than ever 
not to know him on any terms. 

zoo. Yet you would be much more conscious of him, 
would you not? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I should not allow that 
to commit me to any familiarity with the fellow. I have 
been twice at the Summer Sports at the South Pole; and 
this man pretended he had been to the North Pole, which 
can hardly be said to exist, as it is in the middle of the 
sea. He declared he had hung his hat on it. 

zoo [laughing ] He knew that travellers are amusing 
only when they are telling lies. Perhaps if you looked 
at that man through a microscope you would find some 
good in him. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I do not want to find any 
good in him. Besides, madam, what you have just said 
encourages me to utter an opinion of mine which is so 
advanced! so intellectually daring! that I have never ven- 
tured to confess to it before, lest I should be imprisoned 
for blasphemy, or even burnt alive. 

zoo. Indeed! What opinion is that? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [after looking core 

nd| I do not approve of microscopes. { never have. 
ee You call she advanced! Oh, Daddy, that is 
pure obscurantism. ' 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Call it so if you will, 
madam; but I maintain that it is dangerous to shew too 


182 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


much to people who do not know what they are looking 
at. I think that a man who is sane as long as he looks 
at the world through his own eyes is very likely to be- 
come a dangerous madman if he takes to looking at the 
world through telescopes and microscopes. Even when 
he is telling fairy stories about giants and dwarfs, the 
giants had better not be too big nor the dwarfs too smal] 
and too malicious. Before the microscope came, our 
fairy stories only made the children’s flesh creep pleas- 
antly, and did not frighten grown-up persons at all. 
But the microscope men terrified themselves and every- 
one else out of their wits with the invisible monsters 
they saw: poor harmless little things that die at the 
touch of a ray of sunshine, and are themselves the victims 
of all the diseases they are supposed to produce! What- 
ever the scientific people may say, imagination without 
microscopes was kindly and often courageous, because 
it worked on thmgs of which it had some real knowl- 
edge. But imagination with microscopes, working on a 
terrifying spectacle of millions of grotesque creatures 
of whose nature it had no knowledge, became a cruel, 
terror-stricken, persecuting delirium. Are you aware, 
madam, that a general massacre of men of science took 
place in the twenty-first century of the pseudo-Christian 
era, when all their laboratories were demolished, and all 
their apparatus destroyed? 

zoo. Yes: the shortlived are as savage in their ad- 
vances as in their relapses. But when Science crept 
back, it had been taught its place. The mere collectors 
of anatomical or chemical facts were not supposed to 
know more about Science than the collector of used post- 
age stamps about international trade or literature. The 
scientific terrorist who was afraid to use a spoon or a 
tumbler until he had dipt it in some poisonous acid to 
kill the microbes, was no longer given titles, pensions, 


ActI ‘Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 183 


and monstrous powers over the bodies of other people: 
he was sent to an asylum, and treated there until his 
recovery. But all that is an old story: the extension 
of life to three hundred years has provided the human 
race with capable leaders, and made short work of such 
childish stuff. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [ pettishly| You seem to 
credit every advance in civilization to your inordinately 
Jong livers. Do you not know that this question was 
familiar to men who died before they had reached my 
own age? 

zoo. Oh yes: one or two of them hinted at it in a 
feeble way. An ancient writer whose name has come 
down to us in several forms, such as Shakespear, Shel- 
ley, Sheridan, and Shoddy, has a remarkable passage 
about your dispositions being horribly shaken by 
thoughts beyond the reaches of your souls. That does 
not come to much, does it? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. At all events, madam, I 
may remind you, if you come to capping ages, that 
whatever your secondaries and tertiaries may be, you 
are younger than I am. 

zoo. Yes, Daddy; but it is not the number of years 
we have behind us, but the number we have before us, 
that makes us careful and responsible and determined 
to find out the truth about everything. What does it 
matter to you whether anything is true or not? your 
flesh is as grass: you come up like a flower, and wither 
in your second childhood. A lie will last your time: it 
will not last mine. If I knew I had to die in twenty 
years it would not be worth my while to educate myself : 
I should not bother about anything but having a little 
pleasure while I lasted. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Young woman: you are 
mistaken. Shortlived as we are, we—the best of us, I 


184 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


mean—regard civilization and learning, art and science, 
as an ever-burning torch, which passes from the hand of 
one generation to the hand of the next, each generation 
kindling it to a brighter, prouder flame. Thus each hife- 
time, however short, contributes a brick to a vast and 
growing edifice, a page to a sacred volume, a chapter to 
a Bible, a Bible to a literature. We may be insects ; but 
like the coral insect we build islands which become con- 
tinents: like the bee we store sustenance for future com- 
munities. The individual perishes; but the race is im- 
mortal. Tke acorn of today is the oak of the next mil- 
lennium. I throw my stone on the cairn and die; but 
later comers add another stone and yet another; and lo! 
a mountain, I— 

zoo [interrupts him by laughing heartily at him]!!! 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [with offended dignity] 
May I ask what I have said that calls for this merri- 
ment? | 

zoo. Oh, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, you are a funny 
little man, with your torches, and your flames, and your 
bricks and edifices and pages and volumes and chapters 
and coral and insects and bees and acorns and stones and 
mountains. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Metaphors, madam. 
Metaphors merely. 

zoo. Images, images, images. I was talking about 
men, not about images. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. [ was illustrating—not, 
I hope, quite infelicitously—the great march of Prog- 
ress. I was shewing you how, shortlived as we orientals 
are, mankind gains in stature from generation to gen- 
eration, from epoch to epoch, from barbarism to civiliza- 
tion, from civilization to perfection. 

zoo. I see. The father grows to be six feet high, and 
hands on his six feet to his son, who adds another six 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 185 


feet and becomes twelve feet high, and hands his twelve 
feet on to his son, who is full-grown at eighteen feet, and 
so on. In a thousand years you would all be three or 
four miles high. At that rate your ancestors Bilge and 
Bluebeard, whom you call giants, must have been about 
quarter of an inch high. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. [I am not here to bandy 
quibbles and paradoxes with a girl who blunders over 
the greatest names in history. I am in earnest. I am 
treating a solemn theme seriously. I never said that the 
son of a man six feet high would be twelve feet high. 

zoo. You didnt mean that? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Most certainly not. 

zoo. ‘Then you didnt mean anything. Now listen to 
me, you little ephemeral thing. I knew quite well what 
you meant by your torch handed on from generation to 
generation. But every time that torch is handed on, it 
dies down to the tiniest spark; and the man who gets 
it can rekindle it only by his own light. You are no 
taller than Bilge or Bluebeard; and you are no wiser. 
Their wisdom, such as 1t was, perished with them: so 
did their strength, if their strength ever existed outside 
your imagination. I do not know how old you are: you 
look about five hundred— 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Five hundred! Really, 
madam— 

zoo [continuing]; but I know, of course, that you 
are an ordinary shortliver. Well, your wisdom is only 
such wisdom as a man can have before he has had expe- 
rience enough to distinguish his wisdom from his folly, 
his destiny from his delusions, his— 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. In short, such wisdoms as 
your own. 

zoo. No, no, no, no. How often must I tell you that 
we are made wise not by the recollections of our past, but 


186 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


by the responsibilities of our future. I shall be more 
reckless when I am a tertiary than Iam today. If you 
eannot understand that, at least you must admit that I 
have learnt from tertiaries. I have seen their work and 
lived under their institutions. Like all young things 
I rebelled against them; and in their hunger for new 
lights and new ideas they listened to me and encouraged 
me to rebel. But my ways did not work; and theirs did; 
and they were able to tell me why. They have no power 
over me except that power: they refuse all other power; 
and the consequence is that there are no limits to their 
power except the limits they set themselves. You are 
a child governed by children, who make so many mis- 
takes and are so naughty that you are in continual re- 
bellion against them; and as they can never convince you 
that they are right: they can govern you only by beating 
you, imprisoning you, torturing you, killing you if you 
disobey them without being strong enough to kill or 
torture them. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. That may be an unfortu- 
nate fact. I condemn it and deplore it. But our minds 
are greater than the facts. We know better. The 
greatest ancient teachers, followed by the galaxy of 
Christs who arose in the twentieth century, not to men- 
tion such comparatively modern spiritual leaders as 
Blitherinjam, Tosh, and Spiffkins, al] taught that pun- 
ishment and revenge, coercion and militarism, are mis- 
takes, and that the golden rule— 

zoo [interrupting | Yes, yes, yes, Daddy : we longlived 
people know that quite well. But did any of their dis- 
ciples ever succeed in governing you for a single day on 
their Christlike principles? It is not enough to know 
what is good: you must be able to do it. They couldnt 
do it because they did not live long enough to find out 
how to do it, or to outlive the childish passions that pre- 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 187 


vented them from really wanting to do it. You know 
very well that they could only keep order—such as it 
was—by the very coercion and militarism they were de- 
nouncing and deploring. They had actually to kill one 
another for preaching their own gospel, or be killed 
themselves. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. The blood of the martyrs, 
madam, is the seed of the Church. 

zoo. More images, Daddy! The blood of the short- 
lived falls on stony ground. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [rising, very testy] You 
are simply mad on the subject of longevity. I wish you 
would change it. It is rather personal and in bad taste, 
Human nature is human nature, longlived or shortlived, 
and always will be. 

zoo. Then you give up the idea of progress? You 
cry off the torch, and the brick, and the acorn, and all 
the rest of it? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I do nothing of the sort. 
I stand for progress and for freedom broadening down 
from precedent to precedent. 

zoo. You are certainly a true Briton. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I am proud of it. But 
in your mouth I feel that the compliment hides some in- 
sult; so I do not thank you for it. 

zoo. All I meant was that though Britons sometimes 
say quite clever things and deep things as well as silly 
and shallow things, they always forget them ten minutes 
after they have uttered them. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Leave it at that, madam: 
leave it at that. [He sits down again]. Even a Pope 
is not expected to be continually pontificating. Our 
flashes of inspiration shew that our hearts are in the 


right place. 


188 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


zoo. Of course. You cannot keep your heart in any 
place but the right place. 

THE ELDEBLY GENTLEMAN. Tcha! 

zoo. But you can keep your hands in the wrong 
place. In your neighbors’ pockets, for example. So, 
you see, it is your hands that really matter. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [exhausted] Well, a 
woman must have the last word. I will not dispute it 
with you. 

zoo. Good. Now let us go back to the really inter- 
esting subject of our discussion. You remember? The 
slavery of the shortlived to images and metaphors. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [aghast| Do you mean to 
say, madam, that after having talked my head off, and 
reduced me to despair and silence by your intolerable 
loquacity, you actually propose to begin all over again? 
I shall leave you at once. 

zoo. You must not. I am your nurse; and you must 
stay with me. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I absolutely decline to do 
anything of the sort [he rises and walks away with 
marked dignity]. | 

zoo [using her tuning-fork |] Zoo on Burrin Pier to 
Oracle Police at Ennistymon have you got me? . .. 
What? . . . Iam picking you up now but you are 
flat to my pitch. . . . Just ashade sharper. . . . 
Thats better: still a little more. . . . Got you: right. 
Isolate Burrin Pier quick. 

‘THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [is heard to yell] Oh! 

zoo [still intoning] Thanks. . . . Oh nothing 
serious I am nursing a shortliver and the silly creature 
has run away he has discouraged himself very badly by 
gadding about and talking to secondaries and I must 
keep him strictly to heel. 

The Elderly Gentleman returns, indignant. 


ActI ‘Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 189 


zoo. Here he is you can release the Pier thanks. 
Good-bye. [She puts up her tuning-fork]. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. This is outrageous. 
When I tried to step off the pier on to the road, I re- 
ceived a shock, followed by an attack of pins and needles 
which ceased only when I stepped back on to the stones. 

zoo. Yes: there is an electric hedge there. It is a 
very old and very crude method of keeping animals from 
straying. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Weare perfectly familiar 
with it in Baghdad, madam; but I little thought I should 
live to have it ignominously applied to myself. You 
have actually Kiplingized me. 

zoo. Kiplingized! What is that? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. About a thousand years 
ago there were two authors named Kipling. One was 
an eastern and a writer of merit: the other, being a 
western, was of course only an amusing barbarian. He 
is said to have invented the electric hedge. I consider 
that in using it on me you have taken a very great 
liberty. 

zoo. What is a liberty? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [exasperated] I shall not 
explain, madam. I believe you know as well as I do. 
[He sits down on the bollard in dudgeon]. 

zoo. No: even you can tell me things I do not know. 
Havnt you noticed that all the time you have been here 
we have been asking you questions? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Noticed it! It has al- 
most driven me mad. Do you see my white hair? It 
was hardly grey when I landed: there were patches of 
its original auburn still distinctly discernible. 

zoo. That is one of the symptoms of discouragement. 
But have you noticed something much more important to 
yourself: that is, that you have never asked us any 


190 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV, 


questions, although we know so much more than you do? 
- ‘THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I am not a child, madam. 
I believe I have had occasion to say that before. And I 
am an experienced traveller. I know that what the 
traveller observes must really exist, or he could not ob- 
serve it. But what the natives tell him is invariably 
pure fiction. 

zoo. Not here, Daddy. With us life is too long for 
telling lies. They all get found out. Youd better ask 
me questions while you have the chance. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. If I have occasion to con- 
sult the oracle I shall address myself to a proper one: 
to a tertiary: not to a primary flapper playing at being 
an oracle. If you are a nurserymaid, attend to your 
duties; and do not presume to ape your elders. 

zoo [rising ominously and reddening] You silly— 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [thundering] Silence! Do 
you hear! Hold your tongue. 

zoo. Something very disagreeable is happening to 
me. I feel hot all over. I have a horrible impulse to 
Injure you. What have you done to me? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [triumphant] Aha! I have 
made you blush. Now you know what blushing means. 
Blushing with shame! 

zoo. Whatever you are doing, it is something so ut- 
terly evil that if you do not stop I will kill you. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [apprehending his dan- 
ger] Doubtless you think it safe to threaten an old 
man— 

zoo [fiercely] Old! You are a child: an evil child. 
We kill evil children here. We do it even against our 
own wills by instinct. Take care. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [rising with crestfallen 
courtesy | I did not mean to hurt your feelings, J— 
[swallowing the apology with an effort] I beg your 


ActI ‘Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman - 19] 


pardon. [He takes off his hat, and bows]. 

zoo. What does that mean? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I withdraw what I said. 

z00. How can you withdraw what you said? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I can say no more than 
that I am sorry. 

zoo. You have reason to be. That hideous sensation 
you gave me is subsiding; but you have had a very 
narrow escape. Do not attempt to kill me again; for at 
the first sign in your voice or face I shall strike you 
dead. 

THE ELDERLN GENTLEMAN. I attempt to kill you! 
What a monstrous accusation! 

zoo [frowns]! a 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [ prudently correcting him- 
self] I mean misunderstanding. I never dreamt of such 
a thing. Surely you cannot believe that I am a mur- 
derer. 

zoo. I know you are a murderer. It is not merely 
that you threw words at me as if they were stones, mean- 
ing to hurt me. It was the instinct to kill that you 
roused in me. [ did not know it was in my nature: 
never before has it wakened and sprung out at me, warn- 
ing me to kill or be killed. I must now reconsider my 
whole political position. I am no longer a Conservative. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [dropping his hat| Gra- 
cious Heavens! you have lost your senses. JI am at the 
mercy of a madwoman: I might have known it from 
the beginning. I can bear no more of this. [Offering 
his chest for the sacrifice] Kill me at once: and much 
good may my death do you! 

zoo. It would be useless unless all the other short- 
livers were killed at the same time. Besides, it is a 
measure which should be taken politically and constitu- 


192 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


tionally, not privately. However, I am prepared to dis- 
cuss it with you. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. No, no, no. I had much 
rather discuss your intention of withdrawing from the 
Conservative party. How the Conservatives have tol- 
erated your opinions so far is more than I can imagine: 
I can only conjecture that you have contributed very 
liberally to the party funds. [He picks up his hat, and 
sits down again |. 

zoo. Do not babble so senselessly: our chief political 
controversy is the most momentous in the world for you 
and your like. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [interested] Indeed? Pray, 
may I ask what it is? I ama keen politician, and may 
perhaps be of some use. [He puts on his hat, cockmg 
it slightly]. 

zoo. We have two great parties: the Conservative 
party and the Colonization party. The Colonizers are 
of opinion that we should increase our numbers and 
colonize. The Conservatives hold that we should stay 
as we are, confined to these islands, a race apart, 
wrapped up in the majesty of our wisdom on a soil held 
as holy ground for us by an adoring world, with our 
sacred frontier traced beyond dispute by the sea. ‘They 
contend that it 1s our destiny to rule the world, and that 
even when we were shortlived we did so. They say that 
our power and our peace depend on our remoteness, our 
exclusiveness, our separation, and the restriction of our 
numbers. Five minutes ago that was my political faith. 
Now I do not think there should be any shortlived people 
at all. [She throws herself again carelessly on the 
sacks}. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. ‘Am I to infer that you 
deny my right to live because I allowed myself—per- 
haps injudiciously—to give you a slight scolding? 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 193 


zoo. Is it worth living for so short atime? Are you 
any good to yourself? 
re ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [stupent] Well, upon my 
soul! 

zoo. It is a very little soul. You only encourage 
the sin of pride in us, and keep us looking down at you 
instead of up to something higher than ourselves. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Is not that a selfish view, 
madam? Think of the good you do us by your oracular 
counsels! 

zoo. What good have our counsels ever done you? 
You come to us for advice when you know you are in 
difficulties. But you never know you are in difficulties 
until twenty years after you have made the mistakes 
that led to them; and then it is too late. You cannot 
understand our advice: you often do more mischief by 
trying to act on it than if you had been left to your 
own childish devices. If you were not childish you 
would not come to us at all: you would learn from expe- 
rience that your consultations of the oracle are never 
of any real help to you. You draw wonderful imag- 
inary pictures of us, and write fictitious tales and poems 
about our beneficent operations in the past, our wisdom, 
our justice, our mercy: stories in which we often ap- 
pear as sentimental dupes of your prayers and sacri- 
fices; but you do it only to conceal from yourselves 
the truth that you are incapable of being helped by us. 
Your Prime Minister pretends that he has come to be 
guided by the oracle; but we are not deceived: we know 
quite well that he has come here so that when he goes 
back he may have the authority and dignity of one who 
has visited the holy islands and spoken face to face with 
the ineffable ones. He will pretend that all the meas- 
ures he wishes to take for his own purposes have been 
enjoined on him by the oracle. 


194 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. But you forget that the 
answers of the oracle cannot be kept secret or misrepre- 
sented. They are written and promulgated. The 
Leader of the Opposition can obtain copies. All the 
nations know them. Secret diplomacy has been totally 
abolished. 

zoo. Yes: you publish documents; but they are 
garbled or forged. And even if you published our real 
answers it would make no difference, because the short- 
lived cannot interpret the plainest writings. Your scrip- 
tures command you in the plainest terms to do exactly 
the contrary of everything your own laws and chosen 
rulers command and execute. You cannot defy Nature. 
It is a law of Nature that there is a fixed relation be- 
tween conduct and length of life. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I have never heard of any 
such law, madam. 

zoo. Well, you are hearing of it now. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Let me tell you that we 
shortlivers, as you call us, have lengthened our lives very 
considerably. 

zoo. How? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. By saving time. By en- 
abling men to cross the ocean in an afternoon, and to see 
and to speak to one another when they are thousands of 
miles apart. We hope shortly to orgaize their labor, 
and press natural forces into their service, so scientifi- 
cally that the burden of labor will cease to be perceptible, 
leaving common men more leisure than they will know 
what to do with. 

zoo. Daddy: the man whose life is lengthened in this 
way may be busier than a savage; but the difference be- 
tween such men living seventy years and those living 
three hundred would be all the greater; for to a short- 
liver increase of years is only increase of sorrow; but to 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 195 


a longliver every extra year is a prospect which forces 
him to stretch his faculties to the utmost to face it, 
Therefore I say that we who live three hundred years 
can be of no use to you who live less than a hundred, 
and that our true destiny is not to advise and govern 
you, but to supplant and supersede you. In that faith 
I now declare myself a Colonizer and an Exterminator. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Oh, steady! steady! 
Pray! pray! Reflect, I implore you. It is possible to 
colonize without exterminating the natives. Would 
you treat us less mercifully than our barbarous fore- 
fathers treated the Redskin and the Negro? Are we 
not, as Britons, entitled at least to some reservations? 

zoo. What is the use of prolonging the agony? You 
would perish slowly in our presence, no matter what we 
did to preserve you. You were almost dead when I took 
charge of you today, merely because you had talked for 
a few minutes to a secondary. Besides, we have our own 
experience to go upon. Have you never heard that our 
children occasionally revert to the ancestral type, and 
are born shortlived? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [eagerly] Never. I hope 
you will not be offended if I say that it would be a great 
comfort to me if I could be placed in charge of one of 
those normal individuals. 

zoo. Abnormal, you mean. What you ask is im- 
possible: we weed them all out. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. When you say that you 
weed them out, you send a cold shiver down my spine. I 
hope you dont mean that you—that you—that you as- 
sist Nature in any way? 

zoo. Why not? Have you not heard the saying of 
the Chinese sage Dee Ning, that a good garden needs 
weeding? But it is not necessary for us to interfere. 
We are naturally rather particular as to the conditions 


196 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


on which we consent to live. One does not mind the acci- 
dental loss of an arm or a leg or an eye: after all, no 
one with two legs is unhappy because he has not three; 
so why should a man with one be unhappy because he has 
not two? But infirmities of mind and temper are quite 
another matter. If one of us has no self-control, or is 
too weak to bear the strain of our truthful life without 
wincing, or is tormented by depraved appetites and 
superstitions, or is unable to keep free from pain and 
depression, he naturally becomes discouraged, and re- 
fuses to live. | 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Good Lord! Cuts his 
throat, do you mean? 

zoo. No: why should he cut his throat? He simply 
dies. He wants to. He is out of countenance, as we 
call it. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Well!!! But suppose he 
is depraved enough not to want to die, and to settle the 
difficulty by killing all the rest of you? 

zoo. Oh, he is one of the thoroughly degenerate short- 
livers whom we occasionally produce. He emigrates. 

A THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. And what becomes of him 
then? 

zoo. You shortlived people always think very highly 
of him. You accept him as: what you call a great man. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. You astonish me; and 
yet I must admit that what you tell me accounts for a 
great deal of the little I know of the private life of our 
great men. We must be very convenient to you as a 
dumping place for your failures. 

zoo. I admit that. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Good. ‘Then if you carry 
out your plan of colonization, and leave no shortlived 
countries in the world, what will you do with your un- 
desirables ? 


ActI Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 197 


zoo. Killthem. Our tertiaries are not at all squeam- 
ish about killing. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Gracious Powers! 

zoo | glancing up at the sun} Come. It is just six- 
teen o’clock; and you have to join your party at half- 
past in the temple in Galway. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [rising] Galway! Shall I 
at last be able to boast of having seen that magnificent 
city? 

zoo. You will be disappointed: we have no cities. 
There is a temple of the oracle: that is all. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Alas! and I came here to 
fulfil two long-cherished dreams. One was to see Gal- 
way. It has been said, “See Galway and die.” The 
other was to contemplate the ruins of London. 

zoo. Ruins! We do not tolerate ruins. Was Lon- 
don a place of any importance? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [amazed] What! Londen! 
It was the mightiest city of antiquity. [Rhetorically | 
Situate just where the Dover Road crosses the Thames, 
it— 

z00 [curtly interrupting | There is nothing there now. 
Why should anybody pitch on such a spot to live? The 
nearest houses are at a place called Strand-on-the- 
Green: it is very old. Come. We shall go across the 
water. [She goes down the steps}. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Sic transit gloria mundi! 

zoo [from below] What did you say? | 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [despairingly| Nothing. 
You would not understand. [He goes down the steps}. 


ACT II 


A courtyard before the columned portico of a temple. 
The temple door is in the middle of the portico. A veil- 
ed and robed woman of majestic carriage passes along 
behind the columns towards the entrance. From the 
opposite direction a man of compact figure, clean-shaven, 
saturnine, and self-centered, in short, very like Napoleon 
I, and wearing a military uniform of Napoleonic cut, 
marches with measured steps; places his hand in his 
lapel in the traditional manner; and fixes the woman 
with his eye. She stops, her attitude expressing haughty 
amazement at his audacity. He ts on her right: she on 
his left. 


NAPOLEON [impressively| I am the Man of Destiny. 

THE VEILED WOMAN [unimpressed| How did you get 
in here? 

NAPOLEON. Iwalkedin. I go on until I am stopped. 
I never am stopped. I tell you I am the Man of 
Destiny. 

THE VEILED woMAN. You will be a man of very short 
destiny if you wander about here without one of our 
children to guide you. I suppose you belong to the 
Baghdad envoy. 

NAPOLEON. I came with him; but I do not belong to 

198 


200 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


him. I belong to myself. Direct me to the oracle if you 
can. If not, do not waste my time. 

THE VEILED WOMAN. Your time, poor creature, 1s 
short. I will not waste it. Your envoy and his party 
will be here presently. The consultation of the oracle 
is arranged for them, and will take place according to 
the prescribed ritual. You can wait here until they, 
come [she turns to go into the temple]. | 

NAPOLEON. I never wait. [She stops]. The prescribed 
ritual is, I believe, the classical one of the pythoness 
on her tripod, the intoxicating fumes arising from the 
abyss, the convulsions of the priestess as she delivers the 
message of the God, and so on. That sort of thing 
does not impose on me: I use it myself to impose on 
simpletons. I believe that what is,1s. I know that what 
is not, is not. The antics of a woman sitting on a tripod 
and pretending to be drunk do not interest me. Her 
words are put into her mouth, not by a god, but by a. 
man three hundred years old, who has had the capacity 
to profit by his experience. I wish to speak to that mar 
face to face, without mummery or imposture. 

THE VEILED womaN. You seem to be an unusually 
sensible person. But there is no old man. I am the 
oracle on duty today. I am on my way now to take my 
place on the tripod, and go through the usual mum- 
mery, as you rightly call it, to impress your friend the 
envoy. As you are superior to that kind of thing, you 
may consult me now. [She leads the way into the middle 
of the courtyard]. What do you want to know? 

NAPOLEON [following her] Madam: I have not come 
all this way to discuss matters of State with a woman. 
I must ask you to direct me to one of your oldest and 
ablest men. 

THE ORACLE. None of our oldest and ablest men or 
women would dream of wasting their time on you. You 


Act II Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 201 


would die of discouragement in their presence in less 
than three hours. 

NAPOLEON. You can keep this idle fable of dis- 
couragement for people credulous enough to be intimi- 
dated by it, madam. I do not believe in metaphysical 
forces. 

THE ORACLE. No one asks you to. A field is some- 
thing physical, is it not. Well, I have a field. 

NAPOLEON. JI have several million fields. I am Em- 
peror of Turania. 

THE ORACLE. You do not understand. I am not 
speaking of an agricultural field. Do you not know 
that every mass of matter in motion carries with it an 
Invisible gravitational field, every magnet an invisible 
magnetic field, and every living organism a mesmeric 
field? Even you have a perceptible mesmeric field. 
Feeble as it is, it is the strongest I have yet observed in 
a shortliver. 

NAPOLEON. By no means feeble, madam. I under- 
stand you now; and I may tell you that the strongest 
characters blench in my presence, and submit to my 
domination. But I do not call that a physical force. 

THE ORACLE. What else do you call it, pray? Our 
physicists deal with it. Our mathematicians express its 
measurements in algebraic equations. 

NAPOLEON. Do you mean that they could measure 
mine? 

THE ORACLE. Yes: by a figure infinitely near to zero. 
Even in us the force is negligible during our first century 
of life. In our second century it develops quickly, and 
becomes dangerous to shortlivers who venture into its 
field. If I were not veiled and robed in insulating ma- 
terial you could not endure my presence; and I am still 
a young woman: one hundred and seventy if you wish to 


know exactly. 


202 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


NAPOLEON [folding his arms] I am not intimidated : 
no woman alive, old or young, can put me out of coun- 
tenance. Unveil, madam. Disrobe. You will move this 
temple as easily as shake me. | 

THE ORACLE. Very well [she throws back her veil]. 

wapotEon [shricking, staggering, and covering his 
eyes| No. Stop. Hide your face again. [Shutting his 
eyes and distractedly clutching at his throat and heart | 
Let me go. Help! I am dying. 

THE ORACLE. Do you still wish to consult an older 
person? 

NAPOLEON. No,no. The veil, the veil, I beg you. 

THE ORACLE [replacing the veil] So. 

NAPOLEON. Ouf! One cannot always be at one’s 
best. T'wice before.in my life I have lost my nerve and 
behaved like a poltroon. But I warn you not to judge 
my quality by these involuntary moments. 

THE ORACLE. I have no occasion to judge of your 
quality. You want my advice. Speak quickly; or I 
shall go about my business. 

NAPOLEON [after a moment’s hesitation, sinks re- 
spectfully on one knee| I— 

THP ORACLE. Qh, rise, rise. Are you so foolish as 
to offer me this mummery which even you despise? 

NAPOLEON [rising'| I knelt in spite of myself. I com- 
pliment you on your impressiveness, madam. 

THE ORACLE [impatiently| Time! time! time! time! 

NAPOLEON. You will not grudge me the necessary 
time, madam, when you know my case. I am a man 
gifted with a certain specific talent in a degree alto- 
gether extraordinary. I am not otherwise a very 
extraordinary person: my family is not influential ; and 
without this talent I should cut no particular figure in 
the world. 

THE ORACLE. Why cut a figure in the world? 


Act II Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 208 


NAPOLEON. Superiority will make itself felt, madam. 
But when I say I possess this talent I do not express 
myself accurately. The truth is that my talent pos- 
sesses me. It is genius. It drives me to exercise it. I 
must exercise it. I am great when I exercise it. At 
other moments I am nobody. 

THE ORACLE. Well, exercise it. Do you need an 
oracle to tell you that? 

NAPOLEON. Wait. This talent involves the shedding 
of human blood. 

THP ORACLE. Are you a surgeon, or a dentist? 

NAPOLEON. Psha! You do not appreciate me, 
madam. I mean the shedding of oceans of blood, the 
death of millions of men. 

THE ORACLE. They object, I suppose. 

NAPOLEON. Not at all. They adore me. 

THE ORACLE. Indeed! 

NAPOLEON. I have never shed blood with my own 
hand. They kill each other: they die with shouts of 
triumph on their lips. ‘Those who die cursing do not 
curse me. My talent is to organize this slaughter; to 
give mankind this terrible joy which they call glory; to 
let loose the devil in them that peace has bound in chains. 

THE ORACLE. And you? Do you share their joy? 

napoLteon. Not at all. What satisfaction is it to 
me to see one fool pierce the entrails of another with a 
bayonet? I am a man of princely character, but of 
simple personal tastes and habits. I have the virtues of 
a laborer: industry and indifference to personal com- 
fort. But I must rule, because I am so superior to other 
men that it is intolerable to me to be misruled by them. 
Yet only as a slayer can I become a ruler. I cannot be 
great as a writer: I have tried and failed. I have no 
talent as a sculptor or painter; and as lawyer, preacher, 
doctor, or actor, scores of second-rate men can do as 


204 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV. 


well as ), or better. I am not even a diplomatist: I can 
only play my trump card of force. What I can do is to 
organize war. Look at me! I seem a man like other 
men, because nine-tenths of me is common humanity. 
But the other tenth is a faculty for seeing things as 
they are that no other man possesses. 

THE ORACLE. You mean that you have no imag- 
ination? 

napotzon [forcibly] I mean that I have the only 
imagination worth having: the power of imagining 
things as they are, even when I cannot see them. You 
feel yourself my superior, I know: nay, you are my 
superior: have I not bowed my knee to you by instinct? 
Yet I challenge you to a test of our respective powers. 
Can you calculate what the mathematicians call 
vectors, without putting a single algebraic symbol on 
paper? Can you launch ten thousand men across a 
frontier and a chain of mountains and know to a mile 
exactly where they will be at the end of ‘seven weeks? 
The rest is nothing: I got it all from the books at my 
military school. Now this great game of war, this play- 
ing with armies as other men play with bowls and 
skittles, is one which I must go on playing, partly be- 
cause a man must do what he can and not what he 
would like to do, and partly because, if I stop, I 
immediately lose my power and become a beggar in the 
land where I now make men drunk with glory. 

THE ORACLE. No doubt then you wish to know how 
to extricate yourself from this unfortunate position? 

NAPOLEON. It is not generally considered unfor- 
tunate, madam. Supremely fortunate rather. 

THE oractE. If you think so, go on making them 
drunk with glory. Why trouble me with their folly and 
your vectors? 

wapPoLeon. Unluckily, madam, men are not only 


Act II ‘Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 205 


heroes; they are also cowards. They desire glory ; but 
they dread death. 

THE ORACLE. Why should they? Their lives are too 
short to be worth living. That is why they think your 
game of war worth playing. 

NAPOLEON. ‘They do not look at it quite in that way. 
The most worthless soldier wants to live for ever. To 
make him risk being killed by the enemy I have to con- 
vince him that if he hesitates he will inevitably be shot 
at dawn by his own comrades for cowardice. 
eaee oracLeE. And if his comrades refuse to shoot 

um ? 

NAPOLEON. ‘They will be shot too, of course. 

THE ORACLE. By whom? 

NAPOLEON. By their comrades. 

THE ORACLE. And if they refuse? 

NAPOLEON. Up toa certain point they do not refuse. 

THE ORACLE. But when that point is reached, you 
have to do the shooting yourself, eh? 

NAPOLEON. Unfortunately, madam, when that point 
is reached, they shoot me. 

THE ORACLE. Mf! It seems to me they might as well 
shoot you first as last. Why dont they? 

NAPOLEON. Because their love of fighting, their de- 
sire for glory, their shame of being branded as dastards, 
their instinct to test themselves in terrible trials, their 
fear of being killed or enslaved by the enemy, their 
belief that they are defending their hearths and homes, 
overcome their natural cowardice, and make them willing 
not only to risk their own lives but to kill everyone who 
refuses to take that risk. But if war continues too long, 
there comes a time when the soldiers, and also the tax- 
payers who are supporting and munitioning them, reach 
a condition which they describe as being fed up. The 
troops have proved their courage, and want to go home 


206 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV. 


and enjoy in peace the glory it has earned them. Be- 
sides, the risk of death for each soldier becomes a cer- 
tainty if the fighting goes on for ever: he hopes to 
escape for six months, but knows he cannot escape for 
six years. The risk of bankruptcy for the citizen be- 
comes a certainty in the same way. Now what does this 
mean for me? 

THE ORACLE. Does that matter in the midst of such 
calamity? 

NAPOLEON. Psha! madam: it is the only thing that 
matters: the value of human life is the value of the 
greatest living man. Cut off that infinitesimal layer of 
grey matter which distinguishes my brain from that of 
the common man, and you cut down the stature of 
humanity from that of a giant to that of a nobody. I 
matter supremely: my soldiers do not matter at all: 
there are plenty more where they came from. If you kill 
me, or put a stop to my activity (it is the same thing), 
the nobler part of human life perishes. You must save 
the world from that catastrophe, madam. War has 
made me popular, powerful, famous, historically im- 
mortal. But I foresee that if I go on to the end it will 
leave me execrated, dethroned, imprisoned, perhaps 
executed. Yet if I stop fighting I commit suicide as a 
great man and become a common one. How am I to 
escape the horns of this tragic dilemma? Victory I can 
guarantee: I am invincible. But the cost of victory is 
the demoralization, the depopulation, the ruin of the 
victors no less than of the vanquished. How am I to 
satisfy my genius by fighting until I die? that is my 
question to you. 

THE ORACLE. Were you not rash to venture into 
these sacred islands with such a question ou your lips? 
Warriors are not popular here, my friend. 

NAPOLEON. If a soldier were restrained by such a 


Act II Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 207 


consideration, madam, he would no longer be a soldier, 
Besides, [he produces a pistol] I have not come unarmed, 

THE ORACLE. What is that thing? 

NAPOLEON. It is an instrument of my profession, 
madam. I raise this hammer; I point the barrel at you; 
I pull this trigger that is against my forefinger; and 
you fall dead. 

THE ORACLE. Shew it to me [she puts out her hand 
to take it from him]. 

NAPOLEON [retreating a step] Pardon me, madam. 
I never trust my life in the hands of a person over whom 
I have no control. 

THE ORACLE [sternly] Give it to me [she raises her 
hand to her veil]. 

NAPOLEON [dropping the pistol and covering his 
eyes] Quarter! Kamerad! Take it, madam [he kicks 
st towards her |: I surrender. 

THE ORACLE. Give me that thing. Do you expect 
me to stoop for it? 

NAPOLEON [taking his hands from his eyes with an 
effort] A poor victory, madam [he picks up the pistol 
and hands it to her|: there was no vector strategy 
needed to win it. [Making a pose of his humiliation] 
But enjoy your triumph: you have made me—ME! Cain 
Adamson Charles Napoleon! Emperor of Turania! cry 
for quarter. 

THE ORACLE. ‘The way out of your difficulty, Cain 
Adamson, is very simple. 

wapouzon [eagerly] Good. What is it? 

THE ORACLE. ‘To die before the tide of glory turns. 
Allow me [she shoots him]. 

He falls with a shriek. She throws the pistol away 
and goes haughtily mto the temple. 

_- wapoLeon [scrambling to his feet] Murderess! 
Monster! She-devil! Unnatural, inhuman wretch! You

deserve to be hanged, guillotined, broken on the wheel, 


burnt alive. No sense of the sacredness of human life! 
No thought for my wife and children! Bitch! Sow! 
Wanton! [He picks up the pistol]. And missed me at 
five yards! Thats a woman all over. 

He is going away whence he came when Zoo arrives 
and confronts him at the head of a party consisting of 
the British Envoy, the Elderly Gentleman, the Envoy’s 
wife, and her daughter, aged about eighteen. The 
Envoy, a typical politician, looks like an imperfectly 
reformed criminal disguised by a good tailor. The dress 
of the ladies is coeval with that of the Elderly Gentle- 
man, and suitable for public official ceremonies m 
western capitals at the XVIII-XIX fin de siécle. 

They file in under the portico. Zoo wmmediately 
comes out mmperiously to Napoleon’s right, whilst the 
Envoy’s wife hurries effustvely to his left. The Envoy 
meanwhile passes along behind the columns to the door, 
followed by his daughter. The Elderly Gentleman stops 
just where he entered, to see why Zoo has swooped so 
abruptly on the Emperor of Turania. 

zoo [to Napoleon, severely | What are you doing here 
by yourself? You have no business to go about here 
alone. What was that noise just now? What is that in 
your hand? 

Napoleon glares at her in speechless fury; pockets 
the pistol; and produces a whistle. 

THE ENVOY’s wirE. Arnt you coming with us to the 
oracle, sire? 

wapoLteon. To hell with the oracle, and with you 
too [he turns to go|! 


THE ENVOY’S WIFE ) Oh, sire! ! 
cea 4 [together] t Where are you g 
ing? : 


NAPOLEON. ‘To fetch the police. [He goes out past 


Act II Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 209 


Zoo, almost jostling her, and blowing piercing blasts on 
his whistle]. 

Zoo |whipping out her tuning-fork and intoning] 
Hallo Galway Central. [The whistling continues]. 
Stand by to isolate. [To the Elderly Gentleman, who is 
staring after the whistling Emperor| How far has he 
gone? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. To that curious statue 
of a fat old man. 

zoo [quickly, intoning] Isolate the Falstaff monu- 
ment isolate hard. Paralyze—|[the whistling stops]. 
Thank you. [She puts up her tuning fork]. He shall 
not move a muscle until I come to fetch him. 

THE ENVOY’s wirk. Oh! he will be frightfully angry! 
Did you hear what he said to me? 

zoo. Mauch we care for his anger! 

THE DAUGHTER [coming forward between her mother 
and Zoo|. Please, madam, whose statue is 1t? and where 
can I buy a picture postcard of it? Itis so funny. I 
will take a snapshot when we are coming back; but they 
come out so badly sometimes. 

zoo. They will give you pictures and toys in the 
temple to take away with you. The story of the statue 
is too long. It would bore you [she goes past them 
across the courtyard to get rid of them). 

THE wiFE [gushing] Oh no, I assure you. 

THE DAUGHTER [copying her mother] We should be 
so interested. 

zoo. Nonsense! All I can tell you about it is that a 
thousand years ago, when the whole world was given 
over to you shortlived people, there was a war called the 
War to End War. In the war which followed it about 
ten years later, none of the soldiers were killed; but 
seven of the capital cities of Europe were wiped out of 
existence. It seems to have been a great joke: for the 


210 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


statesmen who thought they had sent ten million com- 
mon men to their deaths were themselves blown into 
fragments with their houses and families, while the ten 
million men lay snugly in the caves they had dug for 
themselves. Later on even the houses escaped ; but their 
inhabitants were poisoned by gas that spared no living 
soul. Of course the soldiers starved and ran wild; and 
that was the end of pseudo-Christian civilization. The 
last civilized thing that happened was that the states- 
men discovered that cowardice was a great patriotic 
virtue; and a public monument was erected to its first 
preacher, an ancient and very fat sage called Sir John 
Falstaff. Well [pointing], thats Falstaff. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [coming from the portico 
to his granddaughter’s right | Great Heavens! And at 
the base of this monstrous poltroon’s statue the War 
God of Turania is now gibbering impotently. 

zoo. Serve him right! War God indeed! 

THE ENVOY [coming between his wife and Zoo] I dont 
know any history: a modern Prime Minister has some- 
thing better to do than sit reading books ; but— 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [interrupting him en- 
couragingly| You make history, Ambrose. 

THE ENVOY. Well, perhaps I do; and perhaps his- 
tory makes me. I hardly recognize myself in the news- 
papers sometimes, though I suppose leading articles are 
the materials of history, as you might say. But what 
I want to know is, how did war come back again? and 
how did they make those poisonous gases you speak of ? 
We should be glad to know; for they might come in very 
handy if we have to fight Turania. Of course I am all 
for peace, and dont hold with the race of armaments in 
principle; still, we must keep ahead or be Wiped out. 

zoo You can make the gases for yourselves when 
your chemists find out how. Then you will do as you 


Act If Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 211 


did before: poison each other until there are no chemists 
left, and no civilization, You will then begin all over 
again as half-starved ignorant savages, and fight with 
boomerangs and poisoned arrows until you work up to 
the poison gases and high explosives once more, with 
the same result. That is, unless we have sense enough 
to make an end of this ridicnlous game by destroying 
you. 

THE ENVoy [aghast] Destroying us! 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I told you, Ambrose. I 
warned you. 

THE ENVOY. But— 

z00 [impatiently | I wonder what Zozim is doing. He 
ought to be here to receive you. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Do you mean that rather 
insufferable young man whom you found boring me on 
the pier? 

zoo. Yes. He has to dress-up in a Druids’ robe, and 
put on a wig and a long false beard, to impress you 
silly people. J have to put on a purple mantle. I have 
no patience with such mummery ; but you expect it from 
us; so I suppose it must be kept up. Will you wait here 
until Zozim comes, please [she turns to enter the 
temple}. 

THE ENVOY. My good lady, is it worth while dress- 
ing-up and putting on false beards for us if you tell us 
beforehand that it is all humbug? 

zoo. One would not think so; but if you wont be- 
lieve in anyone who is not dressed-up, why, we must 
dress-up for you. It was you who invented all this non- 
sense, not we. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. But do you expect us ta 
be impressed, after this? 

zoo. I dont expect anything. I know, as a matter 
of experience, that you will be impressed. The oracle 


212 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV. 


will frighten you out of your wits. [She goes into the 
temple]. . 

THE wiFE. ‘These people treat us as if we were dirt 
beneath their feet. I wonder at you putting up with it, 
Amby. It would serve them right if we went home at 
once: wouldnt it, Eth? 

THE DAUGHTER. Yes, mamma. But perhaps they 
wouldnt mind. 

THE ENvoY. No use talking like that, Molly. Ive 
got to see this oracle. The folks at home wont know 
how we have been treated: all theyll know is that Ive 
stood face to face with the oracle and had the straight 
tip from her. I hope this Zozim chap is not going to 
keep us waiting much longer; for I feel far from com- 
fortable about the approaching interview; and thats 
the honest truth. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. JI never thought I should 
want to see that man again; but now I wish he would 
take charge of us instead of Zoo. She was charming at 
first: quite charming; but she turned into a fiend be- 
cause I had a few words with her. You would not 
believe: she very nearly killed me. You heard what she 
said just now. She belongs to a party here which wants 
to have us all killed. 

THE wire [terrified] Us! But we have done nothing: 
we have been as nice to them as nice could be. Oh, Amby, 
come away, come away: there is something dreadful 
about this place and these people. 

THE ENvoy. There is, and no mistake. But youre 
pete with me: you ought to have sense enough to know 

at. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. I am sorry to say, Molly, 
that it is not merely us four poor weak creatures they 
want to kill, but the entire race of Man, except them- 
selves. 


Act II Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 2193 


THE ENVOY. Not so poor, neither, Poppa. Nor so 
weak, if you are going to take in all the Powers. If it 
comes to killing, two can play at that game, longlived 
or shortlived. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. No, Ambrose: we should 
have no chance. We are worms beside these fearful 
people: mere worms. 

Zozim comes from the temple, robed majestically, 
and wearing a wreath of mistletoe in his flowing white 
wig. His false beard reaches almost to his waist. He 
carries a staff with a curiously carved top. 

zozim [in the doorway, impressively] Hail, strangers! 

ALL [reverenily] Hail! 

zozim. Are ye prepared? 

THE ENVOY. We are. 

zozim [unexpectedly becoming conversational, and 
strolling down carelessly to the middle of the group be- 
tween the two ladies] Well, I’m sorry to say the oracle 
is not. She was delayed by some member of your party 
who got loose; and as the show takes a bit of arranging, 
you will have to wait a few minutes. The ladies can go 
inside and look round the entrance hall and get pictures 
and things if you want them. 

} (Thank you. )[They go 
THE WIFE \Ttogether]{I should like to,} into the 
THE DAUGHTER | very much. J temple]. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [in dignified rebuke of 
Zozim’s levity| Taken in this spirit, sir, the show, as 
you call it, becomes almost an insult to our common 
sense. 

zozim. Quite, I should say. You need not keep it up 
with me. 

THE ENVOY [suddenly making himself very agree- 
able] Just so: just so. We can wait as long as you 


214 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


please. And now, if I may be allowed to seize the oppor- 
tunity of a few minutes’ friendly chat—? 

zozim. By all means, if only you will talk about 
things I can understand. 

THE ENvoy. Well, about this colonizing plan of 
yours. My father-in-law here has been telling me some- 
thing about it; and he has just now let out that you 
want not only to colonize us, but to—to—to—well, 
shall we say to supersede us? Now why supersede us? 
Why not live and let live? ‘Theres not a scrap of ill- 
feeling on our side. We should welcome a colony of 
immortals—we may almost call you that—in the British 
Middle East. No doubt the Turanian Empire, with its 
Mahometan traditions, overshadows us now. We have 
had to bring the Emperor with us on this expedition, 
though of course you know as well as I do that he has 
imposed himself on my party just to spy on me. I dont 
deny that he has the whip hand of us to some extent, 
because if it came to a war none of our generals could 
stand up against him. I give him best at that game: he 
is the finest soldier in the world. Besides, he is an em- 
peror and an autocrat; and I ai only an elected repre- 
sentative of the British democracy. Not that our 
British democrats wont fight: they will fight the heads 
off all the Turanians that ever walked; but then it takes 
so long to work them up to it, while he has only to say 
the word and march. But you people would never get 
on with him. Believe me, you would not be as comfort- 
able in Turania as you would be with us. We under- 
stand you. We like you. We are easy-going people; 
and we are rich people. ‘That will appeal to you. 
Turania is a poor place when all is said. Five-eighths 
of it is desert. They dont irrigate as we do. Besides— 
now I am sure this will appeal to you and to all right- 
minded men—we are Christians. 


Act II Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 215 


zozim. ‘The old uns prefer Mahometans. 

THE ENVOY [| shocked | What! 

zozim [distinctly | They prefer Mahometans. Whats 
wrong with that? 

THE ENVOY. Well, of all the disgraceful— 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [diplomatically interrupt- 
ing his scandalized son-tn-law| There can be no doubt, 
I am afraid, that by clinging too long to the obsolete 
features of the old pseudo-Christian Churches we allowed 
the Mahometans to get ahead of us at a very critical 
period of the development of the Eastern world. When 
the Mahometan Reformation took place, it left its fol- 
lowers with the enormous advantage of having the only 
established religion in the world in whose articles of faith 
any intelligent and educated person could believe. 

THE ENVOY. But what about our Reformation? 
Dont give the show away, Poppa. We followed suit, 
didnt we? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Unfortunately, Am- 
brose, we could not follow suit very rapidly. We had 
not only a religion to deal with, but a Church. 

zozim. What is a Church? 

tHE ENvoy. Not know what a Church is! Well! 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. You must excuse me; but 
if I attempted to explain you would only ask me what a 
bishop is; and that is a question that no mortal man can 
answer. All I can tell you is that Mahomet was a truly 
wise man; for he founded a religion without a Church ; 
consequently when the time came for a Reformation of 
the mosques there were no bishops and priests to ob- 
struct it. Our bishops and priests prevented us for two 
hundred years from following suit; and we have never 
recovered the start we lost then. I can only piead that 
we did reform our Church at last. No doubt we had to 
make a few compromises as a matter of good taste; but 


216 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


there is now very little in our Articles of Religion that 
is not accepted as at least allegorically true by our 
Higher Criticism. 

THE ENVOY [encouragingly]| Besides, does it matter? 
Why, I have never read the Articles in my life; and I 
am Prime Minister! Come! if my services in arranging 
for the reception of a colonizing party would be accept- 
able, they are at your disposal. And when I say a 
reception I mean a reception. Royal honors, mind you! 
A salute of a hundred and one guns! The streets lined 
with troops! The Guards turned out at the Palace! 
Dinner at Guildhall! 

zozimM. Discourage me if I know what youre talking 
about! I wish Zoo would come: she understands these 
things. All I can tell you is that the general opinion 
among the Colonizers is in favor of beginning in a 
country where the people are of a different color from 
us; so that we can make short work without any risk of 
mistakes. 

THE ENVOY. What do you mean by short work? I 
hope— 

zozm [with obviously feigned geniality] Oh, nothing, 
nothing, nothing. We are thinking of trying North 
America: thats all. You see, the Red Men of that 
country used to he white. They passed through a period 
of sallow complexions, followed by a period of no com- 
plexions at all, into the red characteristic of their 
climate. Besides, several cases of long life have 
occurred in North America. They joined us here; and 
their stock soon reverted to the original white of these 
islands. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. But have you considered 
the possibility of your colony turning red? 

zozim. ‘That wont matter. We are not particular 
about our pigmentation. The old books mention red- 


Act II Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 217 


faced Englishmen: they appear to have been common 
objects at one time. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [very persuasively| But do 
you think you would be popular in North America? It 
seems to me, if I may say so, that on your own shewing 
you need a country in which society is organized in a 
series of highly exclusive circles, in which the privacy 
of private life is very jealously guarded, and in which no 
one presumes to speak to anyone else without an intro- 
duction following a strict examination of social cre- 
dentials. It is only in such a country that persons of 
special tastes and attainments can form a little world of 
their own, and protect themselves absolutely from in- 
trusion by common persons. I think I may claim that 
our British society has developed this exclusiveness to 
perfection. If you would pay us a visit and see the 
working of our caste system, our club system, our guild 
system, you would admit that nowhere else in the world, 
least of all, perhaps, in North America, which has a 
regrettable tradition of social promiscuity, could you 
keep yourselves so entirely to yourselves, 

zozim [good-naturedly embarrassed] Look here. 
There is no good discussing this. I had rather not ex- 
plain; but it wont make any difference to our Colonizers 
what sort of shortlivers they come across. We shall 
arrange all that. Never mind how. Let us join the 
ladies. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [throwing off his diplo- 
matic attitude and abandoning himself to despair| We 
understand you only too well, sir. Well, kill us. End 
the lives you have made miserably unhappy by opening 
up to us the possibility that any of us may live three 
hundred years. I solemnly curse that possibility. To 
you it may be a blessing, because you do live three hun- 
dred years. To us, who live less than a hundred, whose 


218 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


flesh is as grass, it is the most unbearable burden our 
poor tortured humanity has ever groaned under. 

THE ENVOY. Hullo, Poppa! Steady! How do you 
make that out? 

zozim. What is three hundred years? Short enough, 
if you ask me. Why, in the old days you people lived 
on the assumption that you were going to last out for 
ever and ever and ever. Immortal, you thought your- 
selves. Were you any happier then? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. As President of the 
Baghdad Historical Society I am in a position to inform 
you that the communities which took this monstrous 
pretension seriously were the most wretched of which 
we have any record. My Society has printed an editio 
princeps of the works of the father of history, Thucy- 
derodotus Macollybuckle. Have you read his account 
of what was blasphemously called the Perfect City of 
God, and the attempt made to reproduce it in the north- 
ern part of these islands by Jonhobsnoxius, called the 
Lebiathan? ‘Those misguided people sacrificed the frag- 
ment of life that was granted to them in an imaginary 
immortality. They crucified the prophet who told them 
to take no thought for the morrow, and that here and 
now was their Australia: Australia being a term signi- 
fying paradise, or an eternity of bliss. They tried to 
produce a condition of death in life: to mortify the flesh, 
as they called it. 

zozim. Well, you are not suffering from that, are 
you? You have not a mortified air. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Naturally we are not 
absolutely insane and suicidal. Nevertheless we impose 
on ourselves abstinences and disciplines and studies that 
are meant to prepare us for living three centuries. And 
we seldom live one. My childhood was made unneces- 
sarily painful, my boyhood unnecessarily laborious, by 


Act II Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 219 


ricidulous preparations for a length of days which the 
chances were fifty thousand to one against my ever 
attaining. I have been cheated out of the natural joys 
and freedoms of my life by this dream to which the 
existence of these islands and their oracles gives a 
delusive possibility of realization. I curse the day when 
long life was invented, just as the victims of Jonhobs- 
noxius cursed the day when eternal life was invented. 

zozIM- Pooh! You could live three centuries if you 
choose, ~ 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. ‘That is what the for- 
tunate SERTAAPY to the unfortunate. Well, I do not 
choose I accept my three score and ten years. If they 
are filled with usefulness, with justice, with mercy, with 
good-will: if they are the lifetime of a soul that never 
loses its honor and a brain that never loses its eagerness, 
they are enough for me, because these things are infinite 
and eternal, and can make ten of my years as long as 
thirty of yours. I shall not conclude by saying live as 
Jong as you like and be damned to you, because I have 
risen for the moment far above any ill-will to you or to 
any fellow-creature; but I am your equal before that 
eternity in which the difference between your lifetime 
and mine is as the difference between one drop of water 
ang three in the eyes of the Almighty Power from which 
we have both proceeded. ein. 

= zozim [impressed] You spoke that piece very well, 

Daddy. I couldnt talk like that if I tried. It sounded 
fine. Ah! here come the ladies. 

To his relief, they have just appeared on the 
threshold of the temple. ) 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [passing from ewaltation 
to distress It means nothing to him: in this land of dis- 
couragement the sublime has become the ridiculous. 


[Turning on the hopelessly puzzled Zozim|] “Behold,

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [throwing off the women 
with a superb gesture| Liar! [| Recollecting himself, he 
adds, with noble courtesy, raising his hat and bowing | I 
beg your pardon, sir; but I am NOT discouraged. 

A burst of orchestral music, through which a power- 
ful gong sounds, is heard from the temple. Zoo, in a 
purple robe, appears in the doorway. 

zoo. Come. The oracle is ready. 

Zozim motions them to the threshold with a wave of 
his staff. The Envoy and the Elderly Gentleman take 
off their hats and go into the temple on tiptoe, Zoo 
eading the way. The Wife and Daughter, frightened 
1s they are, raise their heads uppishly and follow flat- 
‘ooted, sustained by a sense of their Sunday clothes and 
toctal consequence. Zozim remains in the portico, alone. 

zozim [taking off his wig, beard, and robe, and 
undling them under his arm] Ouf! [He goes home]. 


ACT ITI 


Inside the temple. A gallery overhanging an abyss. 
Dead silence. The gallery is brighily lighted; but 
beyond is a vast gloom, continually changing in in- 
tensity. A shaft of violet light shoots upward; and a 
very harmonious and silvery carillon chimes. When it 
ceases the violet ray vanishes. 

Zoo comes along the gallery followed by the Envoy’s 
daughter, his wife, the Envoy himself, and the Elderly 
Gentleman. The two men are holding thetr hats with 
the brims near their noses, as if prepared to pray into 
them at a moment’s notice. Zoo halts: they all follow 
her example. They contemplate the void with awe. 
Organ music of the kind called sacred in the nineteenth 
century begins. Their awe deepens. The violet ray, 
now a diffused mist, rises again from the abyss. 

THE WIFE [to Zoo, in a reverent whisper] Shall we 
kneel ? 

zoo [loudly] Yes, if you want to. You can stand on 
your head if you like. [She sits down carelessly on the 
gallery railing, with her back to the abyss]. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [ jarred by her callousness | 
We desire to behave in a becoming manner. 

zoo. Very well. Behave just as you feel. It doesnt 
matter how you behave. But keep your wits about you 
when the pythoness ascends, or you will forget the ques- 
tions you: have come to ask her.

The Envoy’s wife falls on her knees, and takes 
refuge im prayer. 

THE DAUGHTER [trembling] Are you really going to 
see a woman who has lived three hundred years? 

zoo. Stuff! Youd drop dead if a tertiary as much 
as looked at you. The oracle is only a hundred and 
seventy; and youll find it hard enough to stand her. 

THE DAUGHTER |[piteously| Oh! [she falls on her 
knees |. 

THE ENvoy. Whew! Stand by me, Poppa. This is 
a little more than I bargained for. Are you going to 
kneel; or how? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Perhaps it would be in 
better taste. 

The two men kneel. 

Ihe vapor of the abyss thickens; and a distant roll 
of thunder seems to come from its depths. The python- 


Act III Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 223 


ess, seated on her tripod, rises slowly from it. She has 
discarded the msulating robe and veil in which she con- 
versed with Napoleon, and is now draped and hooded in 
voluminous folds of a single piece of grey-white stuff. 
Something supernatural about her terrifies the be- 
holders, who throw themselves on their faces. Her out- 
line flows and waves: she is almost distinct at moments, 
and again vague and shadowy: above all, she is larger 
than life-size, not enough to be measured by the flustered 
congregation, but enough to affect them with a dreadful 
sense of her supernaturalness. 

zoo. Get up, get up. Do pull yourselves together, 
you people. 

The Envoy and his family, by shuddering negatively, 
intimate that tt is impossible. The Elderly Gentleman 
manages to get on his hands and knees. 

zoo. Come on, Daddy: you are not afraid. Speak to 
her. She wont wait here all day for you, you know, 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [rising very deferentially 
to his feet| Madam: you will excuse my very natural 
nervousness in addressing, for the first time in my life, 
a—a—a—a goddess. My friend and relative the Envoy 
is unhinged. I throw myself upon your indulgence— 

zoo [interrupting him intolerantly] Dont throw your- 
self on anything belonging to her or you will go right 
through her and break your neck. She isnt solid, like 
you. :

THE ENVOY [rising to his knees] I shall be only too 
glad to go back alive on any terms. If my legs would 
support me I’d just do a bunk straight for the ship. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. No, no. Remember:

THE ENVOY. Dignity be damned! I’m terrified. 
Take me away, for God’s sake.

to the paper|. Ahem! Civilization has reached a crisis. 
We are at the parting of the ways. We stand on the 
brink of the Rubicon. Shall we take the plunge? Al-

Shall we wait until the whole volume is consumed? On 
our right is the crater of the volcano: on our left the 
precipice. One false step, and we go down to annihila-

pauses for breath].

_ zoo. What are you raving about? Ask your ques- 
tion while you have the chance? What is it you want 
to know? 

THE ENVOY [patronizing her in the manner of a Pre- 
mier debating with a very young member of the Opposi- 
tion| A young woman asks me a question. I am always 
glad to see the young taking an interest in politics. It 
is an impatient question; but it is a practical question, 
an intelligent question. She asks why we seek to lift 
a corner of the veil that shrouds the future from our 
feeble vision. 

zoo. I dont. I ask you to tell the oracle what you 
want, and not keep her sitting there all day. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN | warmly] Order, order! 

zoo. What does “Order, order!” mean? 

THE ENVOY. I ask the august oracle to listen to my 
voice— 

zoo. You people seem never to tire of listening to 
your voices; but it doesnt amuse us. What do you 
want? 

THE ENVOY. I want, young woman, to be allowed to 
proceed without unseemly interruptions. 

A low roll of thunder comes from the abyss. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. There! Even the oracle 
is indignant. [To the Envoy] Do not allow yourself 
to be put down by this lady’s rude clamor, Ambrose. 
Take no notice. Proceed.

zoo. I dont know. Does anybody? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [tactfully]You were just 
coming to the election, I think. 

THE ENVOY [reassured] Just so. The election. Now 
what we want to know is this: ought we to dissolve in 
August, or put it off until next spring? 

zoo. Dissolve? In what? [Thunder]. Oh! I beg 
your pardon. That means that the oracle understands 
you, and desires me to hold my tongue. 

THE ENVOY [fervently] I thank the oracle. 

THE WIFE [to Zoo] Serve you right! 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Before the oracle replies, 
I should like to be allowed to state a few of the reasons 
why, in my opinion, the Government should hold on until 
the spring. In the first— 

Terrific lighting and thunder. The Elderly Gentle- 
man is knocked flat; but as he immediately sits up agam 
dazedly tt is clear that he ts none the worse for the shock. 
The ladies cower im terror. The Envoy’s hat is blown 
off ; but he seizes it just as tt quits his temples, and holds 
it on with both hands. He ts recklessly drunk, but quite 
articulate, as he seldom speaks in public without taking 
stimulants before hand. 

THE ENVOY [taking one hand from his hat to make a 
gesture of stilling the tempest | 'Thats enough. We know 
how to take a hint. [ll put the case in three words. I 
am the leader of the Potterbill party. My party is in 
power. I am Prime Minister. The Opposition—the 
Rotterjacks—have won every bye-election for the last 
six months. They— 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [| scrambling heatedly to his 
feet | Not by fair means. By bribery, by misrepresenta- 
tion, by pandering to the vilest prejudices [muttered 
thunder|—I beg your pardon. [He is silent]. 

THE ENVOY. Never mind the bribery and lies. The 


ct III Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 227 


racle knows all about that. The point is that though 
ur five years will not expire until the year after next, 
ur majority will be eaten away at the bye-elections by 
bout Easter. We cant wait: we must start some ques- 
ion that will excite the public, and go to the country 
nit, But some of us say do it now. Others say wait 
J the spring. We cant make up our minds one way or 
he other. Which would you advise? 

zoo. But what is the question that is to excite your 
ublie? 

THE ENVOY. That doesnt matter. I dont know yet. 
Ve will find a question all right,enough. The oracle 
an foresee the future; we cannot. [Thunder]. What 
oes that mean? What have I done now? 

zoo [severely| How often must you be told that we 
annot foresee the future? ‘There is no such thing as 
he future until 1t is the present. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Allow me to point out, 
1adam, that when the Potterbill party sent to consult 
he oracle fifteen years ago, the oracle prophesied that 
he Potterhills would be victorious at the General Elec- 
ion; and they were. So it is evident that the oracle 
an forsee the future, and is sometimes willing to re- 
eal it. 

THE ENVOY. Quite true. Thank you, Poppa. I ap- 
eal now, over your head, young woman, direct to the 
\ugust Oracle, to repeat the signal favor conferred on 
1y illustrious predecessor, Sir Fuller Eastwind, and to 
nswer me exactly as he was answered. 

The oracle raises her hand to command silence. 

atu. Sh-sh-sh! 

Invisible trombones utter three solemn blasts in the 
uunner of Die Zauberflote. 


THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. May I— 


228 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


zoo [quickly] Hush. The oracle is going to speak. 

THE ORACLE. Go home, poor fool. 

She vanishes; and the atmosphere changes to prosai 
daylight. Zoo comes off the railing; throws off het 
robe: makes a bundle of it; and tucks it under her arm. 
The magic and mystery are gone. The women rise to 
their feet. The Envoy’s party stare at one another 
helplessly. | 

zoo. The same reply, word for word, that your illus- 
trious predecessor, as you call him, got fifteen years 
ago. You asked for it; and you got it. And just think 
of all the important questions you might have asked. 
She would have answered them, you know. It is always 
like that. I will go and arrange to have you sent home: 
you can wait for me in the entrance hall. [She goes 
out |. 

THE ENvoy. What possessed me to ask for the same 
answer old Eastwind got? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN, But it was not the same 
answer. The answer to Eastwind was an inspiration to 
our party for years. It won us the election. 

THE ENVOY’S DAUGHTER. I learnt it at school, granpa. 
Tt wasnt the same at all. Icanrepeatit. [She quotes] 
“When Britain was cradled in the west, the east wind 
hardened her and made her great. Whilst the east wind 
prevails Britain shall prosper. The east wind shall 
wither Britain’s enemies in the day of contest. Let the 
Rotterjacks look to it.” 

THE ENvOy. The old man invented that. I kee it all. 
He was a doddering old ass when he came to consult the 
oracle, ‘The oracle uaturally said “Go home, poor fool.” 
There was no sense in saying that to me; but as that 
girl said, I asked for it. What else could the poor old 
chap do but fake up an answer fit for publication? 


Act III Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman 229 


There were whispers about it; but nobody believed them. 
I believe them now. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Qh, I cannot admit that 
Sir Fuller Eastwind was capable of such a fraud. 

THE ENvoyY. He was capable of anything: I knew his 
private secretary. And now what are we going to say? 
You dont suppose I am going back to Baghdad to tell 
the British Empire that the oracle called me a fool, do 
you? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Surely we must tell the 
truth, however painful it may be to our feelings. 

THE ENVOY. I am not thinking of my feelings: I am 
not so selfish as that, thank God. I am thinking of the 
country: of our party. The truth, as you call it, 
would put the Rotterjacks in for the next twenty years. 
It would be the end of me politically. Not that I care 
for that: I am only too willing to retire if you can find 
a better man. Dont hesitate on my account. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. No, Ambrose: you are 
indispensable. There is no one else. 

THE ENvoy. Very well, then, What are you going 
to doP 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. My dear Ambrose, you 
are the leader of the party, not I. What are you going 
to do? 3 

THE ENVOY. I am going to tell the exact truth: thats 
what I’m going to do. Do you take me for a liar? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [puzzled] Oh, I beg your 
pardon. I understood you to say— 

THE ENVOY [cutting him short] You understood me to 
say that I am going back to Baghdad to tell the British 
electorate that the oracle repeated to me, word for word, 
what it said to Sir Fuller Eastwind fifteen years ago. 
Molly and Ethel can bear me out. So must you, if you 


are an hanect man. Come on. 


230 Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman Part IV 


He goes out, followed by his wife and daughter. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [left alone and shrinking 
into an old and desolate figure] What am I to do? I 
am a most perplexed and wretched man. [He falls on 
his knees, and stretches his hands in entreaty over the 
abyss]. invoke the oracle. I cannot go back and con- 
nive at a blasphemous lie. I implore guidance. 

The Pythoness walks in on the gallery behind him, 
and touches him on the shoulder. Her sige ts now natu- 
ral. Her face is hidden by her hood. He flinches as if 
from an electric shock; turns to her; and cowers, cover- 
ing his eyes m terror. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. No: not closetome. Pm 
afraid I cant bear it. 

THE ORACLE [with grave pity| Come: look at me. I 
am my natural size now: what you saw there was only a 
foolish picture of me thrown on a cloud by a lantern. 
How can I help you? 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. They have gone back to 
lie about your answer. I cannot go with them. I cannot 
live among people to whom nothing is real. I have be- 
come incapable of it through my stay here. I implore 
to be allowed to stay. 

THE ORACLE. My friend: if you stay with us you will 
die of discouragement. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. If I go back I shall die 
of disgust and despair. I take the nobler risk. I beg 
you, do not cast me out. 

He catches her robe and holds her. 

THE ORACLE. Take care. I have been here one hun- 
dred and seventy years. Your death does not mean to 
me what it means to you. 

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. It is the meaning of life, 
not of death, that makes banishment so terrible to me. 

THE ORACLE. Be it so, then. You may stay.

She offers him her hands. He grasps them and raises 
himself a little by clinging to her. She looks steadily 
into its face. He stiffens; a little convulsion shakes himy

lived thing! What else could I do for you? 


PART V 
AS FAR AS THOUGHT CAN REACH 
XXXVI 








AS FAR AS THOUGHT CAN REACH 


Summer afternoon in the year 31,920 a.v. A sunlit 
glade at the southern foot of a thickly wooded hill. On 
the west side of it, the steps and columned porch of a 
dainty little classic temple. Between it and the hill, a 
rising path to the wooded heights begins with rough 
steps of stones m the moss. On the opposite side, a 
grove. In the middle of the glade, an altar in the form 
of a low marble table as long as a man, set parallel to 
the temple steps and pointing to the hill. Curved marble 
benches radiate from it into the foreground; but they 
are not joined to it: there is plenty of space to pass be- 
tween the altar and the benches. 

A dance of youths and maidens is in progress. The 
music is provided by a few fluteplayers seated carelessly 
on the steps of the temple. There are no children; and 
none of the dancers seems younger than eighteen. Some 
of the youths have beards. Their dress, like the archi- 
tecture of the theatre and the design of the altar and 
curved seats, resembles Grecian of the fourth century 
B.c., freely handled. They move with perfect balance 
and remarkable grace, racing through a figure like a 

arandole. They neither romp nor hug ™m our manner. 

At the first full close they clap their hands to stop the 
musicians, who recommence with a saraband, durmg. 
which a strange figure appears on the path beyond the 
temple. He is deep in thought, with his eyes closed and

his feet feeling automatically for the rough irregular 
steps as he slowly descends them. Except for a sort of 
linen kilt consisting mainly of a girdle carrying a spor- 
ran and a few minor pockets, he is naked. In physical 
hardihood and uprightness he seems to be in the prime 
of life; and his eyes and mouth show no sign of. age; 
but his face, though fully and firmly fleshed, bears a net- 
work of lines, varying from furrows to hairbreadth 
reticulations, as if Time had worked over every inch of 
tt incessantly through whole geologic periods. His head 
ts finely domed and utterly bald. Except for his eye- 
lashes he ts quite hairless. He is unconscious of his sur- 
roundings, and walks right mto one of the dancing 
couples, separating them. He wakes up and stares 
about him. The couple stop indignantly. The rest 
stop. The music stops. The youth whom he has jostled 
accosts him without malice, but without anything that 
we should call manners. 

THE youtH. Now, then, ancient sleepwalker, why 
dont you keep your eyes open and mind where you are 
going? 

THE ANCIENT [ mild, bland and indulgent] I did not 
know there was a nursery here, or I should not have 
turned my face in this direction. Such accidents cannot 
ae be avoided. Go on with your play: I will turn 

ck, 

THE yourH. Why not stay with us and enjoy life for 
once ina way? We will teach you to dance. 

THE ANCIENT. No, thank you. I danced when I was 
a child like you. Dancing is a very crude attempt to 
get into the rhythm of life. It would be painful to me 
to go back from that rhythm to your babyish gambols: 
in fact I could not do it if I tried. But at your age it 
is pleasant; and I am sorry I disturbed you. | 

THE YouTH. Come! own up: arnt you very unhappy? 


Part V As Far As Thought Can Reach 237 


It’s dreadful to see you ancients going about by your- 
selves, never noticing anything, never dancing, never 
laughing, never singing, never getting anything out of 
life. None of us are going to be like that when we grow 
up. It’s a dog’s life. 

THE ANCIENT, Not at all. You repeat that old 
phrase without knowing that there was once a creature 
on earth called a dog. Those who are interested in ex- 
tinct forms of life will tell you that it loved the sound 
of its own voice and bounded about when it was happy, 
just as you are doing here. It is you, my children, who 
are living the dog’s life. 

THE youtH. ‘The dog must have been a good sensible 
creature: 1t set you a very wise example. You should 
let yourself go occasionally and have a good time. 

THE ANCIENT. My children: be content to let us an- 
cients go our ways and enjoy ourselves in our own 
fashion. 

He turns to go. 

THE MAIDEN. But wait a moment. Why will you not 
tell us how you enjoy yourself? You must have secret 
pleasures that you hide from us, and that you never get 
tired of. I get tired of all our dances and all our tunes. 
T get tired of all my partners. 

THE YoutH [suspiciously] Do you? I shall bear that 
in mind. 

They all look at one another as if there were somé 
sinister significance in what she has said. 

THE MAIDEN. We all do: what is the use of pretend- 
ing we dont? It is natural. 

SEVERAL YOUNG PEOPLE. No, no. We dont. It is 


not natural. 
THE ANCIENT. You are older than he is, I see. You 


are growing up. 


2388 AsFar As Thought Can Reach Part V 


THE MAIDEN. How do you know? I do not look so 
much older, do I? 

THE ancient. Oh, I was not looking at you. Your 
looks do not interest me. 

THE MaipeN. Thank you. 

They all laugh. 

THE youtH. You old fish! I believe you dont know 
the difference between a man and a woman. 

THE ANCIENT. It has long ceased to interest me in the 
way it interests you. And when anything no longer in- 
terests us we no longer know it. 

THE MAIDEN. You havnt told me how I shew my age. 
That is what I want to know. As a matter of fact I 
am older than this boy here: older than he thinks. How 
did you find that out? 

THE ANCIENT. Easily enough. You are ceasing to 
pretend that these childish games—this dancing and 
singing and mating—do not become tiresome and unsat- 
isfying after a while. And you no longer care to pre- 
tend that you are younger than you are. These are the 
signs of adolescence. And then, see these fantastic rags 
with which you have draped yourself. [He takes up a 
piece of her draperies in his hand|. It is rather badly 
worn here. Why do you not get a new one? 

THE MAIDEN. Oh, I did not notice it. Besides, it is 
too much trouble. Clothes are a nuisance. I think I 
shall do without them some day, as you ancients do, 

THE ANCIENT. Signs of maturity. Soon you will give 
up all these toys and games and sweets. 

THE youtH. What! And be as miserable as you! 

THE ANCIENT. Infant: one moment of the ecstasy of 
life as we live it would strike you dead. [He stalks 
gravely out through the grove). 

They stare after him, much damped. 


Part V As Far As Thought Can Reach 239 


THE youTH [to the musicians] Let us have another 
dance, 

The musicians shake their heads; get up from their 
seats on the steps; and troop away into the temple. 
The others follow them, except the Maiden, who sits 
down on the altar. 

THE routH [turning on the steps] Arnt you coming, 
Chloe? 

THE MAIDEN [shakes her head]! 

THE youTH [hurrying back to her] What is the 
matter? 

THE MAIDEN [tragically pensive} I dont know. 

THE rouTH. Then there is something the matter. Is 
that what you mean? 

THE MAIDEN. Yes. Something is happening to me. 
I dont know what. 

THE youTH. You no longer love me. I have seen it 
for a month past. 

THE MAIDEN. Dont you think all that is rather silly? 
We cannot go on as if this kind of thing, this dancing 
and sweethearting, were everything. 

THE youtH. What is there better? What else is 
there worth living for? 

THE MAIDEN. Qh, stuff! Dont be frivolous. 

THE YOUTH. Something horrible is happening to you. 
You are losing all heart, all feeling. [He sits on the 
altar beside her and buries his face in his hands]. I am 
bitterly unhappy. 

THE MAIDEN. Unhappy! Really, you must have a 
very empty head if there is nothing in it but a dance 
with one girl who is no better than any of the other 

irls, 
= THE youTH. You did not always think so, You used 
to be vexed if I as much as looked at another girl. 

THE MAIDEN. What does it matter what I did when 


240 As Far As Thought Can Reach Part V 


Iwasa baby? Nothing existed for me then except what 
I tasted and touched and saw; and I wanted all that for 
myself, just as I wanted the moon to play with. Now 
the world is opening out for me. More than the world: 
the universe. Even little things are turning out to be 
great things, and becoming intensely interesting. Have 
you ever thought about the properties of numbers? 

THE YOUTH [ sitting up, markedly disenchanted] Num- 
bers!!! J cannot imagine anything drier or more re- 
pulsive. 

THE MAIDEN. They are fascinating, just fascinating. 
I want to get away from our eternal dancing and music, 
and just sit down by myself and think about numbers, 

THE YOUTH [rising indignantly | Oh, this is too much. 
J have suspected you for some time past. We have all 
suspected you. All the girls say that you have deceived 
us as to your age: that you are getting flat-chested; 
that you are bored with us; that you talk to the ancients 
when you get the chance. Tell me the truth: how old 
are you? 

THE MAIDEN. Just twice your age, my poor boy. 

THE yourH. Twice my age! Do you mean to say 
you are four? 

THE MAIDEN. Very nearly four. 
eee youtH [collapsing on the altar with a groan] 

THE MAIDEN. My poor Strephon: I pretended I was 
only two for your sake. I was two when you were born. 
I saw you break from your shell; and you were such a 
charming child! You ran round and talked to us all so 
prettily, and were so handsome and well grown, that I 
lost my heart to you at once. But now I seem to have 
lost it altogether; bigger things are taking possession 
of me. Still, we were very happy in our childish way 
for the first year, wernt we? 


Part Vi As Far As Thought Can Reach 241 


STREPHON, I was happy until you began cooling to- 
wards me. 

THE MAIDEN. Not towards you, but towards all the 
trivialities of our life here. Just think. JI have hun- 
dreds of years to live: perhaps thousands. Do you 
suppose I can spend centuries dancing; listening to 
flutes ringing changes on a few tunes and a few notes; 
raving about the beauty of a few pillars and arches; 
making jingles with words; lying about with your arms 
round me, which is really neither comfortable nor con- 
venient; everlastingly choosing colors for dresses, and 
putting them on, and washing; making a business of 
sitting together at fixed hours to absorb our nourish- 
ment; taking little poisons with it to make us delirious 
enough to imagine we are enjoying ourselves; and then 
having to pass the nights in shelters lying in cots and 
losing half our lives in a state of unconsciousness. Sleep 
is a shameful thing: I have not slept at all for weeks 
past. I have stolen out at night when you were all 
lying insensible—quite disgusting, I call it—and wan- 
dered about the woods, thinking, thinking, thinking; 
grasping the world; taking it to pieces; building it up 
again; devising methods; planning experiments to test 
the methods; and having a glorious time. Every morn- 
ing I have come back here with greater and greater re- 
luctance; and I know that the time will soon come—per- 
haps it has come already—when I shall not come back 
at all. 

stREPHON. How horribly cold and uncomfortable! 

THE MAIDEN. Oh, dont talk to me of comfort! Life 
is not worth living if you have to bother about comfort, 
Comfort makes winter a torture, spring an illness, sum- 
mer an oppression, and autumn only a respite. The 
ancients could make life one long frowsty comfort if 
they chose. But they never lift a finger to make them~-

selves comfortable. They will not sleep under a roof. 
They will not clothe themselves: a girdle with a few 
pockets hanging to it to carry things about in is all 
they wear: they will sit down on the wet moss or in a 
gorse bush when there is dry heather within two yards 
of them. Two years ago, when you were born, I did not 
understand this. Now I feel that I would not put my- 
self to the trouble of walking two paces for all the com- 
fort in the world. 

STREPHON. But you dont know what this means to 
me. It means that you are dying to me: yes, just dying. 
Listen tome. [He puts his arm around her]. © 

THE MAIDEN | extricating herself | Dont. We can talk 
quite as well without touching one another. 

STREPHON [horrified] Chloe! Oh, this is the worst 
symptom of all! The ancients never touch one another. 

THE MAIDEN. Why should they? 

sTREPHON. Oh, I dont know. But dont you want to 
touch me? You used to. 

THE MAIDEN. Yes: that is true: I used to. We used 
to think it would be nice to sleep in one another’s arms; 
but we never could go to sleep because our weight 
stopped our circulations just above the elbows. Then 
somehow my feeling began to change bit by bit. I kept 
a sort of interest in your head and arms long after I 
lost interest in your whole body. And now that has 
gone. 

STREPHON. You no longer care for me at all, then? 

THE MAIDEN. Nonsense! [I care for you much more 
seriously than before; though perhaps not so much for 
you in particular. I mean I care more for everybody. 
But I dont want to touch you unnecessarily ; and I cer- 
tainly dont want you to touch me. 

STREPHON [rising decistoely] That finishes it. You 


dislike me, 


Part VAs Far As Thought Can Reach 243 


_THE MAIDEN [impatiently] I tell you again, I do not 
dislike you; but you bore me when you cannot wnder- 
stand; and I think I shall be happier by myself in 
future. You had better get a new companion. What 
about the girl who is to be born today? 

STREPHON. [I do not want the girl who is to be born 
today. How do I know what she will be like? I want 
you. 

THE MAIDEN. You cannot have me. You must recog- 
nize facts and face them. It is no use running after a 
woman twice your age. I cannot make my childhood 
last to please you. The age of love is sweet; but it is 
short; and I must pay nature’s debt. You no longer 
attract me; and I no longer care to attract you. Growth 
is too rapid at my age: I am maturing from week to 
week, 

STREPHON. You are maturing, as you call it—TI call 
it ageing—from minute to minute. You are going much 
further than you did when we began this conversation. 

THE MAIDEN. It is not the ageing that is so rapid. 
It is the realization of it when it has actually happened. 
Now that I have made up my mind to the fact that I 
have left childhood behind me, it comes home to me in 
leaps and bounds with every word you say. 

STREPHON. But your vow. Have you forgotten that? 
We all swore together in that temple; the temple of love. 
You were more earnest than any of us. 

THE MAIDEN [with a grim smile] Never to let our 
hearts grow cold! Never to become as the ancients! 
Never to let the sacred lamp be extinguished! Never to 
change or forget! To be remembered for ever as the 
first company of true lovers faithful to this vow so often 
made and broken by past generations! Ha! ha! Oh, 


dear! 
stREPHON. Well, you need not laugh. It is a beau-

tiful and holy compact; and I will keep it whilst I live. 
Are you going to break it? 

THE MAIDEN. Dear child: it has broken itself. The 
change has come in spite of my childish vow. [She 
rises]. Do you mind if I go into the woods for a walk 
by myself? This chat of ours seems to me an unbear- 
able waste of time. I have so much to think of. 

strEPHON [again collapsing on the altar and cover- 
ing his eyes with his hands} My heart is broken. [He 
weeps |. 

THE MAIDEN [with a shrug] I have luckily got 
through my childhood without that experience. It shows 
how wise I was to choose a lover half my age. [She 
goes towards the grove, and is disappearmg among the 
trees, when another youth, older and manlier than 
Strephon, with crisp hair and firm arms, comes from the 
temple, and calls to her from the threshold |. 

THE TEMPLE youTH. I say, Chloe. Is there any sign 
of the Ancient yet? The hour of birth is overdue. The 
baby is kicking like mad. She will break her shell pre- 
maturely. 

THE MAIDEN [looks across to the hill path; then points 
up it, and says| She is coming, Acis. 

The Maiden turns away through the grove and is lost 
to sight among the trees. 

acis [coming to Strephon] Whats the matter? Has 
Chloe been unkind? 

sTREPHON. She has grown up in spite of all her 
promises. She deceived us about her age. She is four. 

acis. Four! I am sorry, Strephon. I am getting 
on for three myself; and I know what old age is. I 
hate to say “I told you so”; but she was getting a little 
hard set and flat-chested and thin on the top, wasnt she?

val of the Artists. 

STREPHON [rising | What is the use of being born if 
we have to decay into unnatural, heartless, loveless, joy- 
less monsters in four short years? What use are the 
artists 1f they cannot bring their beautiful creations to 
life? I have a great mind to die and have done with it 
all. [He moves away to the corner of the curved seat 
Yarthest from the theatre, and throws himself moodily 
into it]. 

An Ancient Woman has descended the hill path during 
Stephen's lament, and has heard most of tt. She is like 
the He-Ancient, equally bald, and equally without sexual 
charm, but intensely interesting and rather terrifymg. 
Her sex is discoverable only by her voice, as her breasts 
are manly, and her figure otherwise not very different. 
She wears no clothes, but has draped herself rather per- 
functorily with a ceremonial robe, and carries two tm- 
plements like long slender saws. She comes to the altar 
between the two young men. 

THE sHE-ANCIENT [to Strephon] Infant: you are only 
at the beginning of it all. [To Acts] Is the child ready 
to be born? 

acis. More than ready, Ancient. Shouting and kick- 
ing and cursing. We have called to her to be quiet and 
wait until you come; but of course she only half under- 
stands, and is very impatient. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Very well. Bring her out into the 
sun.

erable in my own way than callous in yours. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. You like being miserable? You 
will soon grow out of that. [She returns to the altar]. 

The procession, headed by Acts, emerges from the 
temple. Six youths carry on their shoulders a burden 
covered with a gorgeous but light pall. Before them 
certain official maidens carry a new tunic, ewers of water, — 
silver dishes pierced with holes, cloths, and tmmense 
sponges. The rest carry wands with ribbons, and strew 
flowers. The burden is deposited on the altar, and the 
pall removed. It is a huge egg.

and placing her saws on the altar ready to her hand in a 
businesslike manner] A girl, I think you said?

THE TUNIC BEARER. It 1s a shame. Why cant we

We want new girls.

whacking the egg with it| Be quiet, I tell you. Wait. 
You will be born presently. 

THE EGG. No, no: at once, at once. I want to be born: 
I want to be born. [Violent kicking within the egg, 
which rocks so hard that tt has to be held on the altar by 
the bearers |. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Silence. [The music stops; and 
the egg behaves itself]. 

The She-Ancient takes her two saws, and with a 
couple of strokes rips the egg open. The Newly Born,

and rosy, but with filaments of spare albumen clinging 
to her here and there. Immediately the maidens set to

through the pierced dishes, others to rub her dry 
with cloths. Meanwhile the youths beat the shell to 
little pieces with their wands, all laughing at the Newly 
Born. who laughs imitatively. The Tunic Bearer clothes 
her; and then they lift her to her feet and dance for- 
wards, she dancing with them as best she can. Acts and 
the She-Ancient come forward with them, he stil on the

THE SHE-ANCIENT. What name have you chosen for

love you; and I must have you or I will go back into 
my shell again. _ 

acis. You cant. It’s broken. Look here [pointing 
to Strephon, who has remained in his seat without look-

Look at this poor fellow! —

That means that she has grown up like this Ancient 
here, and has left him. If you choose me, we shal! have 
only a year’s happiness before I break your heart by 
growing up. Better choose the youngest you can find. 

THE NEWLY BORN. I will not choose anyone but you. 
You must not grow up. We will love one another for

THE NEWLY BORN. Do not come near me, you dread-

quite reasonable yet. What can you expect from a child 
less than five minutes old? 

THE NEWLY BoRN. I think I feel a little more reason- 
able now. Of course I was rather young when I said 
that; but the inside of my head is changing very rapidly. 
I should like to have things explained to me. 

acis [to the She-Ancient]| Is she all right, do you 
think? 

The She-Ancient looks at the Newly Born critically; 
feels her bumps like a phrenologist; grips her muscles 
and shakes her limbs; examines her teeth; looks into her 
eyes for a moment; and finally relinquishes her with an 
air of having finished her job. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. She willdo. She may live. 

They all wave their wands and shout for joy. 

‘THE NEWLY BORN [indignant] I may live! Suppose 
there had been anything wrong with me? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Children with anything wrong do 
not live here, my child. Life is not cheap with us. Butg 
you would not have felt anything. 

THE NEWLY BORN. You mean that you would have 
murdered me!

THE SHE-ANCIENT. ‘That is one of the funny words 
the newly born bring with them out of the past. You 
will forget it tomorrow. Now listen. You have four 
years of childhood before you. You will not be very 
happy; but you will be interested and amused by the 
novelty of the world; and your companions here will 
teach you how to keep up an imitation of happiness dur- 
img your four years by what they call arts and sports 
and pleasures. ‘The worst of your troubles is already 
over. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. What! In five minutes? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. No: you have been growing for 
two years in the egg. You began by being several sorts 
of creatures that no longer exist, though we have fossils 
of them. ‘Then you became human; and you passed in 
fifteen months through a development that once cost 
human beings twenty years of awkward stumbling im- 
maturity after they were born. They had to spend fifty 
years more in the sort of childhood you will complete in 
four years. And then they died of decay. But you 
need not die until your accident comes. 

THE NEWLY BORN. What is my accident? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT, Sooner or later you will fall and 
break your neck; or a tree will fall on you; or you will 
be struck by lightning. Something or other must make 
an end of you someday. 

THE NEWLY BORN. But why should any of these 
things happen to me? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. There is no why. They do. 
Everything happens to everybody sooner or later if 
there is time enough. And with us there is eternity. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. Nothing need happen. I never 
heard such nonsense in all my life. I should know how 
to take care of myself. : 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. So you think. 


250 ‘AsFar As Thought Can Reach Part V 


THE NEWLY BoRNn. I dont think: I know. I shall 
enjoy life for ever and ever. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. If you should turn out to be a 
+ person of infinite capacity, you will no doubt find life 
infinitely interesting. However, all you have to do now 
is to play with your companions. ‘They have many 
pretty toys, as you see: a playhouse, pictures, images, 
flowers, bright fabrics, music: above all, themselves; for 
the most amusing child’s toy is another child. At the 
end of four years, your mind will change: you will be- 
come wise; and then you will be entrusted with power. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. But I want power now. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. No doubt you do; so that you 
could play with the world by tearing it to pieces. 

THE NEWLY BORN. Only to see how it is made. I 
should put it all together again much better than before. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. ‘There was a time when children 
were given the world to play with because they promised 
to improve it. They did not improve it; and they 
would have wrecked it had their power been as great as 
that which you will wield when you are no longer a child. 
Until your young companions will instruct you in what- 
ever is necessary. You are not forbidden to speak to 
the ancients; but you had better not do so, as most of 
them have long ago exhausted all the interest there is 
in observing children and conversing with them. [She 
turns to go]. 

THE NEWLY BORN. Wait. Tell me some things that 
I ought to do and ought not to do. I feel the need of 
education. 

They all laugh at her, except the She-Ancient. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. You will have grown out of that 
by tomorrow. Do what you please. [She goes away up 
the hill path].

THE NEWLY BoRN. How could anyone ever get tired

acis. They do. That is, of the same life. They 
manage to change themselves in a wonderful way. You 
meet them sometimes with a lot of extra heads and arms

them with flowers and sing dithyrambs to them and dance 
round them.

acis. Listen here, young one. You must find out 
things for yourself, and not ask questions. For the first 
day or two you must keep your eyes and ears open and 
your mouth shut. Children should be seen and not heard.

The two sculptors issue from the temple. One has a 
beard two feet long: the other is beardless. Between 
them comes a handsome nymph with marked features, 
dark hair richly waved, and authoritative bearing. 

THE AUTHORATATIVE NYMPH [swooping down to the 
centre of the glade with the sculptors, between Acis and 
the Newly Born] Do not try to browbeat me, Arjillax, 
merely because you are clever with your hands. Can you 
play the flute?

Ecrasia: I cannot. What has that to do with it? [He 
is half derisive, half impatient, wholly resolved not to

zcrasia. Well, have you ever hesitated to criticize 
our best flute players, and to declare whether their music 
is good or bad? Pray have I not the same right to 
criticize your busts, though I cannot make images any 
more than you can play? 

ARJILLAx. Any fool can play the flute, or play any- 
thing else, if he practises enough; but sculpture is a 
creative art, not a mere business of whistling into a pipe. 
The sculptor must hhave something of the god in him. 
From his hand comes a form which reflects a spirit. He 
does not make it to please you, nor even to please him- 
self, but because he must. You must take what he gives 
you, or leave it if you are not worthy of it.

not leave it because it is not worthy of me?

ARJILLAX. Of you! Hold your silly tongue, you 
conceited humbug. What do you know about it? 

Ecrasta. I know what every person of culture 
knows: that the business of the artist is to create beauty. 
Until today your works have been full of beauty; and I 
have been the first to point that out. 

ARJILLAX. ‘Thank you for nothing. People have 
eyes, havnt they, to see what is as plain as the sun in 
the heavens without your pointing it out? 

ECRAsIA, You were very glad to have it pointed out. 
You did not call me a conceited humbug then. You 
stifled me with caresses. You modelled me as the genius 
of art presiding over the infancy of your master here

MARTELLUS | a silent and meditative listener, shudders 
and shakes his head, but says nothing |. 

ARJILLAX [quarrelsomely] I was taken in by your 
talk. 

EcRAsIA. J discovered your genius before anyone 
else did. Is that true, or is it not? 

ARJILLAX. Everybody knew I was an extraordinary 
person. When I was born my beard was three feet long. 

EcRasta. Yes; and it has shrunk from three feet to 
two. Your genius seems to have been in the last foot of 
your beard; for you have lost both. 

MARTELLUS [with a short sardonic cachinnation] He! 
My beard was three and a half feet long when I was 
born; and a flash of lightning burnt it off and killed the 
ancient who was delivering me. Without a hair on my 
chin I became the greatest sculptor in ten generations.

busts he placed in the temple to be unveiled today. Well, 
go in and look at them. That is all I have to say.

EcRASIA. Yes, ancients. The one subject.that is by 
the universal consent of all our connoisseurs absolutely 
excluded from the fine arts. [To Arjillaw] How can 
you defend such a proceeding? 

ARJILLAX. If you come to that, what interest can 
you find in the statues of smirking nymphs and postur-

still skilful enough to model them.

a mighty design. Listen.

Martellus stretches himself on the sward beside the 
altar. The Newly Born sits on the temple steps with her 
chim on her hands, ready to devour the first oration she 
has ever heard. The rest sit or stand at ease. 

ARJILLAX. In the records which generations of chil- 
dren have rescued from the stupid neglect of the 
ancients, there has come down to us a fable which, like 
many fables, is not a thing that was done in the past, but 
a thing that is to be done in the future. It is a legend 
of a supernatural being called the Archangel Michael. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. Is thisa story? I want to heara 
story. [She runs down the steps and sits on the altar at 
Arjillax’s feet].

sculptor and painter. He found in the centre of the 
world a temple erected to the goddess of the centre, 
called Mediterranea. ‘This temple was full of silly pic-

not prefer youth and beauty to age and ugliness?

was of my opinion, not yours. He began by paintmg

But when he had done this he was not satisfied; for tl 
temple was no more impressive than it had been befor

things about his newly born ones than any other arti

mind alone at its intensest. And this painting was acl

I too f ound one day that my images of loveliness had 
become vapid, uninteresting, tedious, a waste of time 
and material. I too lost my desire to model limbs, and 
retained only my interest in heads and faces. I, too,

made them in secret, and hid them from you all.

thing that is only pretending to be alive. [T'o Arjillar] 
Your disillusion with your works of beauty is only the 
beginning of your disillusion with images of all sorts. 
As your hand became more skilful and your chisel cut 
deeper, you strove to get nearer and nearer to truth and 
reality, discarding the fleeting fleshly lure, and making 
images of the mind that fascinates to the end. But how 
can so noble an inspiration be satisfied with any image,

the most part with dismay, as dreading that he will bore 
them. Ecrasta is openly contemptuous. 

MARTELLUS. Friends: it is unfortunate that Pyg- 
malion is constitutionally incapable of exhibiting any- 
thing without first giving a lecture about it to explain 
it; but I promise you that if you will be patient he will 
shew you the two most wonderful works of art in the 
world, and that they will contain some of my own very 
best workmanship. Let me add that they will inspire a | 
loathing that will cure you of the lunacy of art for ever. 
[He sits down next the Newly Born, who pouts and 
turns a very cold right shoulder to him, a demonstration 
utterly lost to him]. 

Pygmalion, with the smile of a simpleton, and the 
eager confidence of a fanatical scientist, climbs awk- 
wardly on to the altar. They prepare for the worst.

pyemation. My friends: I will omit the algebra— 

acis, Thank God! 

pyemaLion [continuing ]—because Martellus has 
made me promise to do so. To come to the point, I have 
succeeded in making artificial human beings. Real live 
ones, I mean. 

INCREDULOUS vortces. Oh, come! Tell us another. 
Really, Pyg! Get out. You havnt. What a he! 

pyemation. I tell you I have. I will shew them to 
you. It has been done before. One of the very oldest 
documents we possess mentions a tradition of a biolo- 
gist who extracted certain unspecified minerals from the 
earth and, as it quaintly expresses it, “breathed into 
their nostrils the breath of life.” ‘This is the only tra- 
dition from the primitive ages which we can regard as 
really scientific. There are later documents which 
specify the minerals with great precision, even to their 
atomic weights; but they are utterly unscientific, be- 
cause they overlook the element of life which makes all 
the difference between a mere mixture of salts and gases 
and a living organism. ‘These mixtures were made over 
and over again in the crude laboratories of the Silly- 
Clever Ages; but nothing came of them until the in- 
gredient which the old chronicler called the breath of life 
was added by this very remarkable early experimenter. 
In my view he was the founder of biological science, 

ARJILLAX. Is that all we know about him? It 
doesnt amount to very much, does it? 

pyemaLion. There are some fragments of pictures 
and documents which represent him as walking in a 
garden and advising people to cultivate their gardens. 
His name has come down to us in several forms. One 
of them is Jove. Another is Voltaire, 

Ecrasia. You are boring us to distraction with your 
Voltaire. What about your human beings? 


Part V As Far As Thought Can Reach 261 


ARJILLAX. Aye: come to them. 

PYGMALION. I assure you that these details are in- 
tensely interesting. [Cries of No! ‘They are not! 
Come to the human beings! Conspuez Voltaire! Cut it 
short, Pyg! interrupt him from all sides]. You will see 
their bearing presently. I promise you I will not detain 
you long. We know, we children of science, that the 
universe is full of forces and powers and energies of one 
kind and another. The sap rising in a tree, the stone 
holding together in a definite crystalline structure, the 
thought of a philosopher holding his brain in form and 
operation with an inconceivably powerful grip, the urge 
of evolution: all these forces can be used by us. For 
instance, I use the force of gravitation when I put a 
stone on my tunic to prevent it being blown away when 
I am bathing. By substituting appropriate machines 
for the stone we have made not only gravitation our 
slave, but also electricity and magnetism, atomic attrac- 
tion, repulsion, polarization, and so forth. But hitherto 
the vital force has eluded us; so it has had to create 
machinery for itself. It has created and developed bony 
structures of the requisite strength, and clothed them 
with cellular tissue of such amazing sensitiveness that 
the organs it forms will adapt their action to all the 
normal variations in the air they breathe, the food they 
digest, and the circumstances about which they have to 
think. Yet, as these live bodies, as we call them, are 
only machines after all, it must be possible to construct 
them mechanically. 

argitLax. Everything is possible. Have you done 
it? that is the question. 

pyemaLion. Yes. But that is a mere fact. What 
is interesting is the explanation of the fact. Forgive 
my saying so; but it is such a pity that you artists have 
no intellect. 


262 $AsFar As Thought Can Reach Part V 


EcRrasia [sententiously] I do not admit that. Th 
artist divines by inspiration all the truths that the so 
called scientist grubs up in his laboratory slowly anc 
stupidly long afterwards.

PycMaLion. Not bad for a baby, my pet. But dea 
and alive are very loose terms. You are not half a 


Part V. As Far As Thought Can Reach 263 


much alive as you will be in another month or 0. What 
was wrong with the synthetic protoplasm was that it 
could not fix and conduct the Life Force. It was like a 
wooden magnet or a lightning conductor made of silk: 
it would not take the current. 

acis. Nobody but a fool would make a wooden mag- 
net, and expect it to attract anything. 

PYGMALION. He might if he were so ignorant as not 
to be able to distinguish between wood and soft iron. In 
those days they were very ignorant of the differences 
between things, because their methods of analysis were 
crude. They mixed up messes that were so like proto- 
plasm that they could not tell the difference. But the 
difference was there, though their analysis was too 
superficial and incomplete to detect it. You must re- 
member that these poor devils were very little better than 
our idiots: we should never dream of letting one of them 
survive the day of its birth. Why, the Newly Born 
there already knows by instinct many things that their 
greatest physicists could hardly arrive at by forty 
years of strenuous study. Her simple direct sense of 
space-time and quantity unconsciously solves problems 
which cost their most famous mathematicians years of 
prolonged and laborious calculations requiring such in- 
tense mental application that they frequently forgot to 
breathe when engaged in them, and almost suffocated 
themselves in consequence. 

EcRAsIA. Leave these obscure prehistoric abortions; 
and come back to your synthetic man and woman. 

PremMation. When I undertook the task of making 
synthetic men, I did not waste my time on protoplasm. 
It was evident to me that if it were possible to make 
protoplasm in the laboratory, it must be equally pos- 
sible to begin higher up and make fully evolved muscular 
and nervous tissues, bone, and so forth. Why make the 


264 <AsFarAs Thought Can Reach Part V 


seed when the making of the flower would be no greater 
miracle? J tried thousands of combinations before J] 
succeeded in producing anything that would fix high- 
potential Life Force. 

aRsiLLax. High what? 

PyremMalion. High-po-tential. The Life Force is not 
so simple as you think. A high-potential current of it 
will turn a bit of dead tissue into a philosopher’s brain. 
A. low-potential current will reduce the same bit of tis- 
sue to a mass of corruption. Will you believe me when I 
tell you that, even in man himself, the Life Force used 
to slip suddenly down from its human level to that of a 
fungus, so that men found their flesh no longer growing 
as flesh, but proliferating horribly in a lower form which 
was called cancer, until the lower form of life killed the 
higher, and both perished together miserably? 

MARTELLUS. Keep off the primitive tribes, Pyg- 
malion, They interest you; but they bore these young 
things. 

PYGMALION. JI am only trying to make you under- 
stand. ‘There was the Life Force raging all round me: 
there was I, trying to make organs that would capture 
it as a battery captures electricity, and tissues that 
would conduct it and operate it. It was easy enough to 
make eyes more perfect than our own, and ears with a 
larger range of sound; but they could neither see nor 
hear, because they were not susceptible to the Life 
Force. But it was far worse when I discovered how to 
make them susceptible; for the first thing that hap- 
pened was that they ceased to be eyes and ears and 
turned into heaps of maggots. 

ecRasia. Disgusting! Please stop. 

acis. If you dont want to hear, go away. You go 
ahead, Pyg. 

PYGMALION. I went ahead. You see, the lower 


Part V As Far As Thought Can Reach 265 


potentials of the Life Force could make maggots, but 
not human eyes or ears. I improved the tissue until it 
was susceptible to a higher potential. 

ARJILLAX [intensely interested] Yes; and then? 

PyeMaLion, ‘Then the eyes and ears turned into 
cancers, 

EcRASIA, Qh, hideous! 

PYGMALION. Not at all. That was a great advance. 
It encouraged me so much that I put aside the eyes and 
ears, and made a brain. It wouldnt take the Life Force 
at all until I had altered its constitution a dozen times; 
but when it did, it took a much higher potential, and 
did not dissolve; and neither did the eyes and ears when 
I connected them up with the brain. I was able to make 
a sort of monster: a thing without arms or legs; and it 
really and truly lived for half-an-hour. 

THE NEWLY BORN. MHalf-an-hour! What good was 
that? Why did it die? 

PycMaLion. Its blood went wrong. But I got that 
right; and then I went ahead with a complete human 
body: arms and legs and all. He was my first man. 

ARJILLAX. Who modelled him? 

PYeMALIon. I did. 

MARTELLUS, Do you mean to say you tried your own 
hand before you sent for me? 

PYGMALION. Bless you, yes, several times. My first 
man was the ghastliest creature: a more dreadful mix- 
ture of horror and absurdity than you who have not seen 
him can conceive. 

ARJILLAX. If you modelled him, he must indeed have 
been a spectacle. 

FYGMALION. Oh, it was not his shape. You see I did 
not invent that. I took actual measurements, and 
moulds from my own body. Sculptors do that some- 


266 ‘As Far As Thought Can Reach Part V 


times, you know; though they pretend they dont. 

MARTELLUS. Hm. 

ARJILLAX. Hah! 

PYGMALION. He was all right to look at, at first, or 
nearly so. But he behaved in the most appalling man- 
ner; and the subsequent developments were so disgusting 
that I really cannot describe them to you. He seized all 
sorts of things and swallowed them. He drank every 
fluid in the laboratory. I tried to explain to him that he 
must take nothing that he could not digest and assimi- 
late completely; but of course he could not understand 
me. He assimilated a little of what he swallowed; but 
the process left horrible residues which he had no means 
of getting rid of. His blood turned to poison; and he 
perished in torments, howling. I then perceived that I 
had produced a prehistoric man; for there are certain 
traces in our own bodies of arrangements which enabled 
the earlier forms of mankind to renew their bodies by 
swallowing flesh and grains and vegetables and all sorts 
of unnatural and hideous foods, and getting rid of what 
they could not digest. 

ecrAsIA. But what a pity he died! What a glimpse 
of the past we have lost! He could have told us stories 
of the Golden Age. 

-Pyemation. Not he. He was a most dangerous 
beast. He was afraid of me, and actually tried to kill 
me by snatching up things and striking at me with 
them. I had to give him two or three pretty severe 
shocks before I convinced him that he was at my mercy. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. Why did you not make a woman 
instead of a man? She would have known how to be- 
have herself. 

MARTELLUS. Why did you not make a man and a 
woman? ‘Their children would have been interesting. 

PYGMALION. I intended to make a woman; but after 


Part V. As Far As Thought Can Reach 267, 


my experience with the man it was out of the question, 

EcRasIA. Pray why? 

PYGMALION. Well, it is difficult to explain if you 
have not studied prehistoric methods of reproduction. 
You see the only sort of men and women I could make 
were men and women just like us as far as their bodies 
were concerned. That was how I killed the poor beast 
of aman. [I hadnt provided for his horrible prehistoric 
methods of feeding himself. Suppose the woman had 
reproduced in some prehistoric way instead of being 
oviparous as we are? She couldnt have done it with a 
modern female body. Besides, the experiment might 
have been painful. 

EcRASIA. ‘Then you have nothing to shew us at all? 

PYGMALION. Oh yes I have. I am not so easily 
beaten as that. I set to work again for months to find 
out how to make a digestive system that would deal with 
waste products and a reproductive system capable of 
internal nourishment and incubation. 

EcRAsIA. Why did you not find out how to make them 
hike us? 

STREPHON [crying out in his grief for the first time] 
Why did you not make a woman whom you could love? 
That was the secret you needed. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. Oh yes. How true! How great 
of you, darling Strephon! [She kisses him impulsively }. 

STREPHON [ passionately] Let me alone. 

MARTELLUS. Control your reflexes, child. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. My what! 

mMaRTELLUS. Your reflexes. The things you do with- 
out thinking. Pygmalion is going to shew you a pair of 
human creatures who are all reflexes and nothing else. 
Take warning by them. 

THE NEWLY BORN. But wont they be alive, like us? 

premation. That is a very difficult question to 


268 As¥Far As Thought Can Reach Part V 


answer, my dear. I confess I thought at first I hac 
created living creatures; but Martellus declares they ar 
only automata. But then Martellus is a mystic: J am ¢ 
man of science. He draws a line between an automator 
and a living organism. I cannot draw that line to my 
own, satisfaction. 

MARTELLUS. Your artificial men have no self-con- 
trol. They only respond to stimuli from without. 

PYGMALION. But they are conscious. I have taught! 
them to talk and read; and now they tell lies. That i: 
so very lifelike. 

MARTELLUS. Not at all. If they were alive they 
would tell the truth. You can provoke them to tell any 
silly lie; and you can foresee exactly the sort of lie they 
will tell. Give them a clip below the knee, and they will 
jerk their foot forward. Give them a clip in then 
appetites or vanities or any of their lusts and greeds, 
and they will boast and lie, and affirm and deny, and hate 
and love without the slightest regard to the facts that 
are staring them in the face, or to their own obvious 
limitations. That proves that they are automata. 

premation | unconvinced] I know, dear old chap; but 
there really is some evidence that we are descended from 
creatures quite as limited and absurd as these. After all, 
the baby there is three-quarters an automaton. Look 
at-the way she has been going on! 

THE NEWLY BORN [indignantly] What do you meani 
How have I been going on? 

EcRASIA. If they have no regard for truth, they can 
have no real vitality. 

PrcMALION. ‘Truth is sometimes so artificial: so 
relative, as we say in the scientific world, that it is very 
hard to feel quite sure that what is false and even 
ridiculous to us may not be true to them.

than the best? 

PYGMALION. JI couldnt. I tried. I failed. I am 
convinced that what I am about to shew you is the very 
highest living organism that can be produced in the 
laboratory. The best tissues we can manufacture will 
not take as high potentials as the natural product: that 
is where Nature beats us. You dont seem to understand, 
any of you, what an enormous triumph it was to pro- 
duce consciousness at all.

Oh, I thought they couldnt understand. Have they 
feelings? 

PYGMALION. Of course they have. I tell you they 
have all the reflexes. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. But feelings are not reflexes. 

PYGMALION. ‘They are sensations. When the rays of 
light enter their eyes and make a picture on their 
retinas, their brains become conscious of the picture and 
they act accordingly. When the waves of sound started 
by your speaking enter their ears and record a dispar- 
aging remark on their keyboards, their brains become 
conscious of the disparagement and resent it accord- 
ingly. If you did not disparage them they would not 
resent it. They are merely responding to a stimulus.

Free will is an illusion. We are the children of Cause 
and Effect. We are the Unalterable, the Irresistible, the 
Irresponsible, the Inevitable.

THE MALE FIGURE. Silence, base accident of Nature. 
This [taking the hand of the Female Figure and in- 
troducing her] is Cleopatra-Semiramis, consort of the 
king of kings, and therefore queen of queens. Ye are 
things hatched from eggs by the brainless sun and the 


272 AsFar As Thought Can Reach Part V 


blind fire; but the king of kings and queen of queens 
are not accidents of the egg: they are thought-out and 
hand-made to receive the sacred Life Force. There is 
one person of the king and one of the queen; but the 
Life Force of the king and queen is all one: the glory 
equal, the majesty co-eternal. Such as the king is so is 
the queen, the king thought-out and hand-made, the 
queen thought-out and hand-made. The actions of the 
king are caused, and therefore determined, from the be- 
ginning of the world to the end; and the actions of the 
queen are likewise. The king logical and predetermined 
and inevitable, and the queen logical and predetermined 
and inevitable. And yet they are not two logical and 
predetermined and inevitable, but one logical and prede- 
termined and inevitable. Therefore confound not the 
persons, nor divide the substance; but worship us twain 
as one throne, two in one and one in two, lest by error ye 
fall into irretrievable damnation. 

THE FEMALE FicurE. And if any say unto you 
“Which one?” remember that though there is one person 
of the king and one of the queen, yet these two persons 
are not alike, but are woman and man, and that as 
woman was created after man, the skill and practice 
gained in making him were added to her, wherefore she 
is to be exalted above him in all personal respects, and— 

THE MALE FIGURE. Peace, woman; for this is a 
damnable heresy. Both Man and Woman are what they 
are and must do what they must according to the eternal 
laws of Cause and Effect. Look to your words; for if 
they enter my ear and jar too repugnantly on my sen- 
sorium, who knows that the inevitable response to that 
stimulus may not be a message to my muscles to snatch 
up some heavy object and break you in pieces.

THE HE-ANCIENT. Silence, I say. 

He knocks the Male Automaton upright by a very 
light flip under the chin. The Female Automaton hardly 
dares to sob. The immortals contemplate them with 
shame and loathing. The She-Ancient comes from the 
trees opposite the temple. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Somebody wants me. What is the 


276 (AsFar As Thought Can Reach Part V 


matter? [She comes to the left hand of the Female 
Figure, not seeing the body of Pygmalion]. Pf! 
[Severely] You have been making dolls. You must 
not: they are not only disgusting: they are dangerous. 

THE FEMALE FIGURE [snivelling piteously| I’m not a 
doll, mam. I’m only poor Cleopatra-Semiramis, queen 
of queens. [Covering her face with her hands] Oh, 
don’t look at me like that, mam. Imeantnoharm. He 
hurt me: indeed he did. | 

THE HE-ANCIENT. The creature has killed that poor 
youth. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT [seeing the body of Pygmalion] 
What! This clever child, who promised so well! 

THE FEMALE FIGURE. He made me. I had as much 
right to kill him as ‘he had to make me. And how was 
I to know that a little thing like that would kill him? 
I shouldnt die if he cut off my arm or leg. 

EcrAsia. What nonsense! 

MARTELLUS. It may not be nonsense. I daresay if 
you cut off her leg she would grow another, like the 
lobsters and the little lizards. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Did this dead boy make these two 
things? 

MARTELLUS. He made them in his laboratory. I 
moulded their limbs. E am sorry. I was thoughtless: 
E did not foresee that they would kill and pretend to 
be persons they were not, and declare things that were 
false, and wish evil. I thought they would be merely 
mechanical fools. | 

THE MALE FIGURE. Do you blame us for our human 
nature? 

THP FEMALE FIGURE. We are flesh and blood and 
not angels. 

THE MALE FicuRE. Have you no hearts?

May we not destroy them? 

STREPHON. We abhor them. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. We loathe them. 

EcRkasia. ‘They are noisome. 

Acts. I dont want to be hard on the poor devils; 
but they are making me feel uneasy in my inside. I 
never had such a sensation before. 

MARTELLUS. I took a lot of trouble with them. But 
as far as I am concerned, destroy them by all means. 
I loathed them from the beginning. 

ALL, Yes, yes: we all loathe them. Let us calcine 
them. 

THE FEMALE FicurE. Oh, dont be so cruel. I’m not 
fit to die. I will never bite anyone again. I will tel] 
the truth. I will do good. Is it my fault if I was not 
made properly? Kill him; but spare me. 

|THE MALE FicuRE. No! I have done no harm: she 
has. Kill her if you like: you have no right to kill me. 

THE NEWLY BORN. Do you hear that? They want to 
have one another killed. 

ARJILLAX. Monstrous! Kall them both. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Silence. These things are mere 
automata: they cannot help shrinking from death at any 
cost. You see that they have no self-control, and are 
merely shuddering through a series of reflexes. Let us 
see whether we cannot put a little more life into them. 
[He takes the Male Figure by the hand, and places his 
disengaged hand on its head]. Now listen. One of you 
two is to be destroyed. Which of you shall it be? 

THE MALE FicureE [after a slight convulsion during 
which his eyes are fixed on the He-Ancient] Spare her;

THE NEWLY BORN. Ohno, I want you. I love you. 

STREPHON. I love someone else. And she has gone 
old, old. Lost to me for ever. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. How old? 

STREPHON. You saw her when you barged into us as 
we were dancing. She is four. 

THE NEWLY BORN. How I should have hated her 
twenty minutes ago! But I have grown out of that 
now. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Good. That hatred is called 
jealousy, the worst of our childish complaints. 

Martellus, dusting his hands and puffing, returns from 
the grove. 

MABTELLUS. Ouf! [He sits down next the Newly 
Born| That job’s finished. 

ARJILLAx. Ancients: I should like to make a few 
studies of you. Not portraits, of course: I shall ideal- 
ize you a little. I have come to the conclusion that you 
ancients are the most interesting subjects after all. 

MARTELLUS. What! Have those two horrors, whose 
ashes I have just deposited with peculiar pleasure in 
poor Pygmalion’s dustbin, not cured you of this silly 
image-making? 

ARJILLAX. Why did you model them as young things, 
you fool? If Pygmalion had come to me, I should have 
made ancients of them for him. Not that I should have 
modelled them any better. I have always said that no 
one can beat you at your best as far as handwork is 
concerned. But this job required brains. That is 
where I should have come in. 

MARTELLUS. Well, my brainy boy, you are welcome 
to try yourhand. There are two of Pygmalion’s pupils 
at the laboratory who helped him to manufacture the 


PartV As Far As Thought Can Reach 281 


bones and tissues and all the rest of it. They can turn 
out a couple of new automatons; and you can model 
them as ancients if this venerable pair will sit for you. 

EcRASIA | decisively] No. No more automata. They 
are too disgusting. 

acis [returning from the temple] Well, thats done. 
Poor old Pyg! 

EcRASIA. Only fancy, Acis! Arjillax wants to make 
more of those abominable things, and to destroy even 
their artistic character by making ancients of them. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. You wont sit for them, will you? 
Please dont. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Children, listen. 

acts [striding down the steps to the bench and seating 
himself next Ecrasia| What! Even the Ancient wants 
to make a speech! Give it mouth, O Sage. 

STREPHON. For heaven’s sake dont tell us that the 
earth was once inhabited by Ozymandiases and Cleo- 
patras. Life is hard enough for us as 1t is. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Life is not meant to be easy, my 
child; but take courage: it can be delightful. What I 
wanted to tell you is that ever since men existed, children 
have played with dolls. 

ecrasiA. You keep using that word. What are 
dolls, pray? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. What you call works of art. 
Images. We call them dolls. 

ARJILLAX. Just so. You have no sense of art; and 
you instinctively insult it. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Children have been known to make 
dolls out of rags, and to caress them with the deepest 
fondness. 2 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Eight centuries ago, when I was 
a child, I made a rag doll. The rag doll is the dearest 
of all. 


982 As Far As Thought Can Reach Part V 


THE NEWLY BORN [eagerly interested | Oh! Have you 
got it still? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. I kept it a full week. 

ecrasia. Even in your childhood, then, you did not 
understand high art, and adored your own amateur 
crudities. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. How old are you? 

EcRasIA. Hight months. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. When you have lived as long as 
IT have— 

ecrasia [interrupting rudely] I shall worship rag 
dolls, perhaps. ‘Thank heaven, I am still in my prime. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. You are still capable of thanking, 
though you do not know what you thank. You are a 
thanking little animal, a blaming little animal, a— 

acts. A gushing little animal. 

aggitLax. And, as she thinks, an artistic little ani- 
mal.. 

Ecrasia [netiled] I am an animated being with a 
reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting. If your 
Automata had been properly animated, Martellus, they 
would have been more successful. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. That is where you are wrong, my 
child. If those two loathsome things had been rag dolls, 
they would have been amusing and lovable. The Newly 
Born here would have played with them; and you would 
all have laughed and played with them too until you 
had torn them to pieces; and then you would have 
laughed more than ever. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. Of course we should. Isnt that 
funny? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. When a thing is funny, search it 
for a hidden truth. 

STREPHON. Yes; and take all the fun out of it. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Do not be so embittered because 


PartV, As Far As Thought Can Reach 283 


your sweetheart has outgrown her love for you. The 
Newly Born will make amends. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. Qh yes: I will be more than she 
could ever have been. 

STREPHON. Psha! Jealous! 

THE NEWLY BoRN. Oh no. I have grown out of 
that. I love her now because she loved you, and because 
you love her. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. That is the next stage. You are 
getting on very nicely, my child. 

MARTELLUS. Come! what is the truth that was 
hidden in the rag doll? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Well, consider why you are not 
content with the rag doll, and must have something more 
closely resembling a real living creature. As you grow 
up you make images and paint pictures. Those of you 
who cannot do that make stories about imaginary dolls 
Or you dress yourselves up as dolls and act plays about 
them. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. And, to deceive yourself the more 
completely, you take them so very very seriously that 
Ecrasia here declares that the making of dolls is the 
holiest work of creation, and the words you put into the 
mouths of dolls the sacredest of scriptures and the 
noblest of utterances. 

EcRASIA. ‘Tush! 

ARJILLAX. Tosh! 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Yet the more beautiful they be- 
come the further they retreat from you. You cannot 
caress them as you caress the rag doll. You cannot cry 
for them when they are broken or lost, or when you pre- 
tend they have been unkind to you, as you could when 
you played with rag dolls. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. At last, like Pygmalion, you de 


284 As Far As Thought Can Reach Part V 


mand from your dolls the final perfection of resemblance 
to life. They must move and speak. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. They must love and hate. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. ‘They must think that they think. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. They must have soft flesh and 
warm blood. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. And then, when you have achieved 
this as Pygmalion did; when the marble masterpiece is 
dethroned by the automaton and the homo by the ho- 
munculus; when the body and the brain, the reasonable 
soul and human flesh subsisting, as Ecrasia says, stand 
before you unmasked as mere machinery, and your im- 
pulses are shewn to be nothing but reflexes, you are 
filled with horror and loathing, and would give worlds 
to be young enough to play with your rag doll again, 
since every step away from it has been a step away from 
Jove and happiness. Is it not true? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Speak, Martellus: you who have 
travelled the whole path. 

MARTELLUS. It is true. With fierce joy I turned a 
temperature of a million degrees on those two things I 
had modelled, and saw them vanish in an instant into 
inoffensive dust. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Speak, Arjillax: you who have 
advanced from imitating the lightly living child to the 
intensely living ancient. Is it true, so far? 

ABJILLAX. Itis partly true: I cannot pretend to be 
satisfied now with modelling pretty children. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. And you, Ecrasia: you cling to 
your highly artistic dolls as the noblest projections of 
the Life Force, do you not? 

Ecrasia. Without art, the crudeness of reality 
would make the world unbearable. 

THE NEWLY BoEN [anticipating the She-Ancient, who 
is evidently going to challenge her] Now you are com- 


PartV As Far As Thought Can Reach 285 


ing to me, because I am the latest arrival. But I dont 
understand your art and your dolls at all. I want to 
caress my darling Strephon, not to play with dolls. 

acis. I am in my fourth year, and I have got on 
very well without your dolls. I had rather walk up a 
mountain and down again than look at all the statues 
Martellus and Arjillax ever made. You prefer a statue 
to an automaton, and a rag doll to a statue. So doI; 
ae I prefer a man to a rag doll. Give me friends, not 
dolls. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Yet I have seen you walking over 
the moutains alone. Have you not found your best 
friend in yourself? 

acts. What are you driving at, old one? What 
does all this lead to? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. It leads, young man, to the truth7— 
that you can create nothing but yourself. 

acis [musing] I can create nothing but myself. 
Ecrasia: you are clever. Do you understand it? I 
dont. 

EcCRASIA. It is as easy to understand as any other 
ignorant error. What artist is as great as his own 
works? He can create masterpieces; but he cannot im- 
prove the shape of his own nose. 

acts. There! What have you to say to that, old 
one? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. He can alter the shape of his own 
soul. He could alter the shape of his nose if the dif- 
ference between a turned-up nose and a turned-down one / 
were worth the effort. One does not face the throes of | 
creation for trifles. 

acts. What have you to say to that, Ecrasia? 

gcRasIA. I say that if the ancients had thoroughly: 
grasped the theory of fine art they would understand, 
that the difference between a beautiful nose and an ugly 


2386 As Far As Thought Can Reach Part V 


one is of supreme importance: that it is indeed the only 
thing that matters. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. That is, they would understand 
something they could not believe, and that you do not 
believe, | 

acis. Just so,mam. Art is not honest: that is why 
I never could stand much of it. It is all make-believe. 
Ecrasia never really says things: she only rattles her 
teeth in her mouth. 

EcRAsIA. Acis: you are crude. 

acts, You mean that I wont play the game of make- 
believe. Well, I dont ask you to play it with me; so 
why should you expect me to play it with you? 

EcRasia. You have no right to say that I am not 
sincere. I have found a happiness in art that real life 
has never given me. I am intensely in earnest about 
art. There is a magic and mystery in art that you 
know nothing of. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT, Yes, child: art is the magic mir- 
ror you make to reflect your invisible dreams in visible 
pictures. You use a glass mirror to see your face: you 
use works of art to see your soul. But we who are older 
use neither glass mirrors nor works of art. We have a 
‘direct sense of life. When you gain that you will put 
aside your mirrors and statues, your toys and your 
dolls. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Yet we too have our toys and our 
dolls. That is the trouble of the ancients. 

ARJILLAX. What! The ancients have troubles! It 
is the first time I ever heard one of them confess it. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Look at us. Look at me. This 
is my body, my blood, my brain; but it is not me. Iam 
the eternal life, the perpetual resurrection; but [strik- 
ing his body] this structure, this organism, this make- 
shift, can be made by a boy in a laboratory, and is held 


PartV As Far As Thought Can Reach 287 


back from dissolution only by my use of it. Worse still, 
it can be broken by a slip of the foot, drowned by a 
cramp in the stomach, destroyed by a flash from the 
clouds. Sooner or later, its destruction is certain. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Yes: this body is the last doll to 
be discarded. When I was a child, Ecrasia, I, too, was 
an artist, like your sculptor friends there, striving to 
rreate perfection in things outside myself. I made 
statues: I painted pictures: I tried to worship them. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. I had no such skill; but I, like 
Acis, sought perfection in friends, in lovers, in nature, 
in things outside myself. Alas! I could not create it: I 
could only imagine it. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. I, like Arjillax, found out that 
my statues of bodily beauty were no longer even beau- 
tiful to me; and I pressed on and made statutes and pic- 
tures of men and women of genius, like those in the old 
fable of Michael Angelo. Like Martellus, I smashed 
them when I saw that there was no life in them: that they 
were so dead that they would not even dissolve as a dead 
body does. . 

THE HE-ANCIENT. And I, like Acis, ceased to walk 
over the mountains with my friends, and walked alone; 
for I found that I had creative power over myself but 
none over my friends. And then I ceased to walk on 
the mountains; for I saw that the mountains were dead. 

acis [protesting vehemently] No. I grant you about 
the friends perhaps; but the mountains are still the 
mountains, each with its name, its individuality, its up- 
standing strength and majesty, its beauty— 

EcRAsIA. What! Acis among the rhapsodists! 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Mere metaphor, my poor boy: the 
mountais are corpses. 

ALL THE youne [repelled] Oh! 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Yes. In the hardpressed heart of 


288 As Far As Thought Can Reach Part V 


the earth, where the inconceivable heat of the sun still 
glows, the stone lives in fierce atomic convulsion, as we 
live in our slower way. When it is cast out to the sur- 
face it dies like a deep-sea fish: what you see is only its 
cold dead body. We have tapped that central heat as 
prehistoric man tapped water springs; but nothing has 
come up alive from those flaming depths: your land- 
scapes, your mountains, are only the world’s cast skins 
and decaying teeth on which we live like microbes. 

Ecrasia. Ancient: you blaspheme against Nature 

and against Man. 
.\ THE sHE-ANCIENT. Child, child, how much enthusi- 
asm will you have for man when you have endured eight 
centuries of him, as I have, and seen him perish by an 
empty mischance that is yet a certainty? When I dis- 
carded my dolls as he discarded his friends and his moun- 
tains, it was to myself I turned as to the final reality. 
Here, and here alone, I could shape and create. When 
my arm was weak and I willed it to be strong, I could 
create a roll of muscle on it; and when I understood 
that, I understood that I could without any greater mir- 
acle give myself ten arms and three heads. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. I also came to understand such 
miracles. For fifty years I sat contemplating this 
power in myself and concentrating my will. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. So did I; and for five more years 
I made myself into all sorts of fantastic monsters. I 
walked upon a dozen legs: I worked with twenty hands 
and a hundred fingers: I looked to the four quarters 
of the compass with eight eyes out of four heads. 
Children fled in amazement from me until I had to hide 
myself from them; and the ancients, who had forgotten 
how to laugh, smiled grimly when they passed. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. We have all committed these fol- 
hes. You will all commit them, 


/ 


PartV As Far As Thought Can Reach 289 


THE NEWLY BORN. Qh, do grow a lot of arms and 
legs and heads for us. It would be so funny. 
THE HE-ANCIENT. My child: I am just as well as I 
ae I would not lift my finger now to have a thousand 
eads. 


THE SHE-ANCIENT. But what would I not giveto have 
no head at all? 


ALL THE younGc. Whats that? No head at all? 
Why? How? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Can you not understand? 

ALL THE roune [shaking their heads] No. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. One day, when I was tired of 
learning to walk forward with some of my feet and 
backwards with others and sideways with the rest all 
at once, I sat on a rock with my four chins resting on 
four of my palms, and four of my elbows resting on 
four of my knees. And suddenly it came into my mind 
that this monstrous machinery of heads and limbs was 
no more me than my statues had been me, and that it 
was only an automaton that I had enslaved. 

MARTELLUS. Enslaved? What does that mean? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. A thing that must do what you 
command it is a slave; and its commander is its master. 
These are words you will learn when your turn comes. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. You will also learn that when the 
master has come to do everything through the slave, the 
slave becomes his master, since he cannot live without 
him. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. And so I perceived that I had 
made myself the slave of a slave. | 

THE HE-ANCIENT. When we discovered that, we shed 
our superfluous heads and legs and arms until we had 
our old shapes again, and no longer startled the children. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. But still I am the slave of this 
slave, my body. How am I to be delivered from it? 


290 As Far As ‘Lhought Can Reach Part V 


THE HE-ANCIENT. 'That, children, is the trouble of 
the ancients. For whilst we are tied to this tyrannous 
body we are subject to its death, and our destiny is not 
achieved. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. What is your destiny? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. To be immortal. 
~ THE SHE-ANCIENT. ‘The day will come when there will 
be no people, only thought. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. And that will be life eternal. 

ecrasia. [I trust I shall meet my fatal accident be- 
‘fore that day dawns. 

ARJILLAX. For once, Ecrasia, I agree with you. A 
world in which there were nothing plastic would be an 
utterly miserable one. 

EcRasIA. No limbs, no contours, no exquisite lines 
and elegant shapes, no worship of beautiful bodies, no 
poetic embraces in which cultivated lovers pretend that 
their caressing hands are wandering over celestial hills 
and enchanted valleys, no— 

acis [interrupting her disgustedly| What an in- 
human mind you have, Ecrasia! 

ECRASIA. Inhuman! 

acts, Yes: inhuman. Why dont you fall in love 
with someone? 

ecrasiaA. I! I have been in love all my life. I 
burned with it even in the egg. 

acis. Not abit of it. You and Arjillax are just as 
hard as two stones. 

gecRasia. You did not always think so, Acis. 

acis. Oh, I know. I offered you my love once, and 
asked for yours. 

Ecrasta. And did I deny it to you, Acis? 

acts. You didnt even know what love was. 

ecrasta. Qh! I adored you, you stupid oaf, until I 
found that you were a mere animal. 


Pat V As Far As Thought Can Reach 291 


acts, And I made no end of a fool of myself about 
you until I discovered that you were a mere artist. You 
appreciated my contours! I was plastic, as Arjillax 
says. J wasnt a man to you: I was a masterpiece ap- 
pealing to your tastes and your senses. Your tastes and 
senses had overlaid the direct impulse of life in you. 
And because I cared only for one life, and went straight 
to it, and was bored by your calling my limbs fancy 
names and mapping me into mountains and valleys and 
all the rest of it, you called me an animal. Well, I am 
an animal, if you call a live man an animal. 

ECRASIA. You need not explain. You refused to be 
refined. I did my best to lift your prehistoric impulses 
on to the plain of beauty, of imagination, of romance, 
of poetry, of art, of— 

acis. These things are all very well in their way and 
in their proper places. But they are not Jove. They 
are an unnatural adulteration of love. Love is a simple 
thing and a deep thing: it is an act of life and not an 
illusion. Art is an illusion. 

argittax. That is false. The statue comes to life 
always. ‘The statues of today are the men and women 
of the next incubation. I hold up the marble figure be- 
fore the mother and say, “This is the model you must 
copy.” We produce what we see. Let no man daré to 
create in art a thing that he would not have exist in life. 

MARTELLUS. Yes: I have been through all that. 
But you yourself are making statues of ancients instead 
of beautiful nymphs and swains. And Ecrasia is right 
about the ancients being inartistic. They are damna- 
bly inartistic. 

ecrasta [triumphant] Ah! Our greatest artist vm- 
dicates me. Thanks, Martellus. 

MARTELLUS. 'The body always ends by being a bore. 
Nothing remains beautiful and interesting except 


292 As Far As Thought Can Reach Part V 


thought, because the thought is the life. Which is just 
what this old gentleman and this old lady seem to think 
too. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. Quite so. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Precisely. 

THE NEWLY BoRN [to the He-Ancient] But you cant 
be nothing. What do you want to be? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. A vortex. 

THE NEWLY BoRN. A what? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. A vortex. I began as a vortex: 
why should I not end as one? 

gecrasia. Oh! That is what you old people are. Vor- 
ticists. 

acts. But if life is thought, can you live without a 
head? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Not now perhaps. But prehistoric 
men thought they could not live without tails. I can 
live without a tail, Why shouldI not live without a 
head? 

THE NEWLY BORN. What is a tail? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. ‘A habit of which your ancestors 
managed to cure themselves, 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. None of us now believe that all 
this machinery of flesh and blood is necessary It dies. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. It imprisons us on this petty 
planet and forbids us to range through the stars. 

acis. But even a vortex is a vortex in something. 
You cant have a whirlpool without water; and you cant 
have a vortex without gas, or molecules or atoms or ions 
or electrons or something, not nothing. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. No: the vortex is not the water 
nor the gas nor the atoms: it is a power over these 
things. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. ‘The body was the slave of the 
vortex; but the slave has become the master; and we 


PartV As Far As Thought Can Reach 293 


must free ourselves from that tyranny. It is this stuff 
Lindicating her body], this flesh and blood and bone and 
all the rest of it, that is intolerable. Even prehistoric 
man dreamed of what he called an astral body, and asked 
who would deliver him from the body of this death. 

acis [evidently out of his depth] ¥ shouldnt think too 
much about it if I were you. You have to keep sane, 
you know. 

The two Ancients look at one another; shrug their 
shoulders; and address themselves to their departure. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. Weare staying too long with you, 
children. We must go. 

All the young people rise rather eagerly. 

ARJILLAX. Dont mention it. 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. It is tiresome for us, too. You 
see, children, we have to put things very crudely to you 
to make ourselves intelligible. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. And I am afraid we do not quite 
succeed. 

STREPHON. Very kind of you to come at all and talk 
to us, I’m sure. 

EcRasia. Why do the other ancients never come and 
give us a turn? 

THE HE-ANCIENT. It is so difficult for them. They 
have forgotten how to speak ; how to read; even how to 
think in your fashion. We do not communicate with 
one another in that way or apprehend the world as you 
do. 

THE HE-ANCIENT. I find it more and more difficult to 
keep up your language. Another century or two and 
it will be impossible. I shall have to be relieved by a 
younger shepherd. 

acts. Of course we are always delighted to see you; 
but still, if it tries you very severely, we could manage 
pretty well by ourselves, you know. | 


294 As Far As Thought Can Reach Part V 


THE SHE-ANCIENT. ‘Tell me, Acis: do you ever think 
of yourself as having to live perhaps for thousands of 
years? 

acts. Oh, dont talk about it. Why, I know very 
well that I have only four years of what any reasonable 
person would call living; and three and a half of them 
are already gone. 

EcRasIA. You must not mind our saying so; but 
really you cannot call being an ancient living. 

THE NEWLY BORN [ almost in tears | Oh, this dreadful 
shortness of our lives! JI cannot bear it. 

. STREPHON. I made up my mind on that subject long 
ago. When I am three years and fifty weeks old, I shall 
have my fatal accident. And it will not be an accident. 

THE HE--ANCIENT. We are very tired of this subject. 
I must leave you. 

THE NEWLY BORN. What is being tired? 

THE SHE-ANCIENT. The penalty of attending to 
children. Farewell. 

The two Ancients go away severally, she into the 
grove, he up to the hills behind the temple. 

att. Ouf! [A great sigh of relief}. 

ecrasIA. Dreadful people! 

STREPHON. Bores! 

MARTELLUS. Yet one would like to follow them: to 
enter into their life; to grasp their thought; to compre- 
hend the universe as they must. 

ARJILLAX. Getting old, Martellus? 

MARTELLUS. Well, I have finished with the dolls; and 
[am no longer jealous of you. That looks like the end. 
Two hours sleep is enough for me. I am afraid I am 
beginning to find you all rather silly. 

STREPHON. I know. My girl went off this morning. 
She hadnt slept for weeks. And she found mathematics 
more interesting than me. 





PartV As Far As Thought Can Reach 295 


MARTELLUS. 'There is a prehistoric saying that has 
come down to us from a famous woman teacher. She 
said: ‘‘Leave women; and study mathematics.” It is 
the only remaining fragment of a lost scripture called 
The Confessions of St. Augustin, the English Opium 
Eater. That primitive savage must have been a great 
woman, to say a thing that still lives after three hundred 
centuries. JI too will leave women and study mathe- 
inatics, which I have neglected too long. Farewell, 
children, my old playmates. I almost wish I could feel 
sentimental about parting from you; but the cold truth 
is that you bore me. Do not be angry with me: your 
turn will come. [He passes away gravely mto the 
grove. | 

angiuuax. There goes a great spirit. What a 
sculptor he was! And now, nothing! It is as if he 
had cut off his hands. 

THE NEWLY BORN. Oh, will you all leave me as he has 
left you? 

ecrasia. Never. We have sworn it. 

STREPHON. What is the use of swearing? She swore. 
He swore. You have sworn. They have sworn. 

ecrasia. You speak like a grammar. 

STREPHON. ‘That is how one ought to speak, isnt it? 
We shall all be forsworn. 

THE NEWLY BORN. Do not talk like that. You are 
saddening us; and you are chasing the light away. It 
is growing dark. 

acts. Night is falling. The light will come back 
to-morrow. 

THE NEWLY BORN. What is tomorrow? 

acts. The day that never comes. [He turns towards 
the temple. | 

All begin trooping into the temple. 


PartV As Far As Thought Can Reach 297 


After all, I can imagine a lover nobler than any of you. 
[She goes into the temple]. 

It is now quite dark. A vague radiance appears near 
the temple and shapes itself into the ghost of Adam. 

A WOMAN'S Voicx [in the grove] Who is that? 

ADAM. The ghost of Adam, the first father of man- 
kind. Who are you? 

THE voice. The ghost of Eve, the first mother of 
mankind. 

ADAM. Come forth, wife; and shew yourself to me 

EVE [appearing near the grove| Here I am, husband. 
You are very old. 

A voice [in the hills] Ha! ha! ha! 

apaM. Who laughs? Who dares laugh at Adam? 

EvE. Who has the heart to laugh at Eve? 

THE voice. The ghost of Cain, the first child, and 
the first murderer. [He appears between them; and as 
he does so there is a prolonged hiss|. Who dares hiss 
at Cain, the lord of death? 

A voice. The ghost of the serpent, that lived before 
Adam and before Eve, and taught them how to bring 
ferth Cain. [She becomes visible, coiled in the tree]. 

A voicr. There is one that came before the serpent. 

THE SERPENT. That is the voice of Lilith, in whom 
the father and mother were one. Hail, Lilith! 

Lilith becomes visible between Cain ard Adam. 

LiuitH. JI suffered unspeakably; I tore myself asun- 
der; I lost my life, to make of my one flesh these twain, 
man and woman. And this is what has come of it. 
What do you make of it, Adam, my son? 

ApAM. I made the earth bring forth by my labor, 
and the woman bring forth by my love. And this is 
what has come of it. What do you make of it, Eve, my 
wife? 

EVE. I nourished the egg in my body and fed it with 


PartV As Far As Thought Can Reach 299 


of the garden, and make an end of the crawling things 
and the flying things and of all them that refuse to tive 
forever? J had patience with them for many ages: they 
tried me very sorely. They did terrible things: they 
embraced death, and said that eternal life was a fable. 
I stood amazed at the malice and destructiveness of the 
things I had made: Mars blushed as he looked down on 
the shame of his sister planet: cruelty and hypocrisy be- 
came so hideous that the face of the earth was pitted 
with the graves of little children among which living 
8keletons crawled in search of horrible food.. The pangs 
of another birth were already upon me when one man 
repented and lived three hundred years; and I waited to 
see what would come of that. And so much came of it 
that the horrors of that time seem now but an evil dream. 
They have redeemed themselves from their vileness, and 
turned away from their sins. Best of all, they are still 
not satisfied: the impulse I gave them in that day when 
I sundered myself in twain and launched Man and 
Woman on the earth still urges them: after passing a 
million goals they press on to the goal of redemption 
from the flesh, to the vortex freed from matter, to the 
whirlpool in pure intelligence that, when the world 
began, was a whirlpool in pure force. And though vall 
that they have done seems but the first hour of the infinite 
work of creation,syet I will not supersede them until 
they have forded this last stream that lies between flesh 
and spirit, and disentangled their life from the matter 
that has always mocked it. I can wait: waiting and 
patience mean nothing to the eternal. I gave the 
woman the greatest of gifts: curiosity. By that her 
seed has been saved from my wrath; for I also am curi- 
ous; and I have waited always to see what they will do 
tomorrow. Let them feed that appetite well for me. I 
say, let them dread, of all things, stagnation; for from
